AB  - Return-to-sport (RTS) decisions are critical to clinical sports medicine and are often characterised by uncertainties, such as re-injury risk, time pressure induced by competition schedule and social stress from coaches, families and supporters. RTS decisions have implications not only for the health and performance of an athlete, but also the sports organisation. RTS decision-making is a complex process, which relies on evaluating multiple biopsychosocial factors, and is influenced by contextual factors. In this narrative review, we outline how RTS decision-making of clinicians could be evaluated from a decision analysis perspective. To begin with, the RTS decision could be explained as a sequence of steps, with a decision basis as the core component. We first elucidate the methodological considerations in gathering information from RTS tests. Second, we identify how decision-making frameworks have evolved and adapt decision-making theories to the RTS context. Third, we discuss the preferences and perspectives of the athlete, performance coach and manager. We conclude by proposing a framework for clinicians to improve the quality of RTS decisions and make recommendations for daily practice and research. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Current trends in sports monitoring are characterized by the massive collection of tech-based biomechanical, physiological and performance data, integrated through mathematical algorithms. However, the application of algorithms, predicated on mechanistic assumptions of how athletes operate, cannot capture, assess and adequately promote athletes’ health and performance. The objective of this paper is to reorient the current integrative proposals of sports monitoring by re-conceptualizing athletes as complex adaptive systems (CAS). CAS contain higher-order perceptual units that provide continuous and multilevel integrated information about performer–environment interactions. Such integrative properties offer exceptional possibilities of subjective monitoring for outperforming any objective monitoring system. Future research should investigate how to enhance this human potential to contribute further to athletes’ health and performance. This line of argument is not intended to advocate for the elimination of objective assessments, but to highlight the integrative possibilities of subjective monitoring. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Foot pressure distribution can be used as a quantitative parameter for evaluating anatomical deformity of the foot and for diagnosing and treating pathological gait, falling, and pressure sores in diabetes. The objective of this study was to propose a deep learning model that could predict pressure distribution of the whole foot based on information obtained from a small number of pressure sensors in an insole. Methods: Twenty young and twenty older adults walked a straight pathway at a preferred speed with a Pedar-X system in anti-skid socks. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model was used to predict foot pressure distribution. Pressure values of nine major sensors and the remaining 90 sensors in a Pedar-X system were used as input and output for the model, respectively. The performance of the proposed LSTM structure was compared with that of a traditionally used adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS). A low-cost insole system consisting of a small number of pressure sensors was fabricated. A gait experiment was additionally performed with five young and five older adults, excluding subjects who were used to construct models. The Pedar-X system placed parallelly on top of the insole prototype developed in this study was in anti-skid socks. Sensor values from a low-cost insole prototype were used as input of the LSTM model. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by applying a leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Correlation coefficient and relative root mean square error (RMSE) of the LSTM model were 0.98 (0.92 ~ 0.99) and 7.9 ± 2.3%, respectively, higher than those of the ANFIS model. Additionally, the usefulness of the proposed LSTM model for fabricating a low-cost insole prototype with a small number of sensors was confirmed, showing a correlation coefficient of 0.63 to 0.97 and a relative RMSE of 12.7 ± 7.4%. Conclusions: This model can be used as an algorithm to develop a low-cost portable smart insole system to monitor age-related physiological and anatomical alterations in foot. This model has the potential to evaluate clinical rehabilitation status of patients with pathological gait, falling, and various foot pathologies when more data of patients with various diseases are accumulated for training. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: While adolescents have specific risk factors for acute and chronic injury, there is a lack of preventive medicine algorithms for this vulnerable group. Shear wave elastography (SWE) is currently mainly used for assessing muscle and tendon stiffness in adult athletes and can diagnose tissue pathologies such as tendinopathy. The aim was to investigate differences in quadriceps tendon and muscle stiffness between adolescent and adult professional soccer players using SWE and identify lateral imbalances in order to improve the knowledge of preventive medicine algorithms for professional adolescent athletes. Methods: Standardized SWE examinations of both lower limb tendons and muscles (the quadriceps tendon (QT) and the vastus medialis (VM) muscle) in the longitudinal plane and relaxed tendon position were performed in 13 healthy adolescent soccer athletes (13–17 years), and a control group of 19 healthy adult professional soccer athletes (18–29 years). Results: Adolescent soccer players had lower stiffness values for both the quadriceps tendon (3.11 m/s vs. 3.25 m/s) and the vastus medialis muscle (1.67 m/s vs. 1.71 m/s) than adult athletes. Moreover, QT stiffness in adolescent soccer players was significantly lower on the right side (QT: adult 3.50 m/s (2.73–4.56) vs. adolescent 2.90 m/s (2.61–3.12); p = 0.031). Analysis of the lateral differences revealed softer QT and VM tissue on the right side in over two-thirds of adolescent soccer athletes. Over two-thirds of adults had stiffer QT and VM tissue on the right side. Conclusion: In adolescent soccer players, the stiffness of the QT and VM muscle measured by SWE is lower in the right leg. SWE of the musculoskeletal system may thus become a relevant diagnostic tool to detect early lateral imbalances as a main risk factor for injury and may thus contribute to the prevention of acute and chronic injury prevention in adolescent athletes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: An increasing number of musculoskeletal injury prediction models are being developed and implemented in sports medicine. Prediction model quality needs to be evaluated so clinicians can be informed of their potential usefulness. Objective: To evaluate the methodological conduct and completeness of reporting of musculoskeletal injury prediction models in sport. Methods: A systematic review was performed from inception to June 2021. Studies were included if they: (1) predicted sport injury; (2) used regression, machine learning, or deep learning models; (3) were written in English; (4) were peer reviewed. Results: Thirty studies (204 models) were included; 60% of studies utilized only regression methods, 13% only machine learning, and 27% both regression and machine learning approaches. All studies developed a prediction model and no studies externally validated a prediction model. Two percent of models (7% of studies) were low risk of bias and 98% of models (93% of studies) were high or unclear risk of bias. Three studies (10%) performed an a priori sample size calculation; 14 (47%) performed internal validation. Nineteen studies (63%) reported discrimination and two (7%) reported calibration. Four studies (13%) reported model equations for statistical predictions and no machine learning studies reported code or hyperparameters. Conclusion: Existing sport musculoskeletal injury prediction models were poorly developed and have a high risk of bias. No models could be recommended for use in practice. The majority of models were developed with small sample sizes, had inadequate assessment of model performance, and were poorly reported. To create clinically useful sports musculoskeletal injury prediction models, considerable improvements in methodology and reporting are urgently required. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Patellofemoral disorders are more common in female runners compared to their male counterparts. Differences in biomechanical characteristics between groups of runners could provide insight into the causes of higher rates of injury in female versus male runners, which would be useful to physical therapists and athletic trainers in development of individualized injury prevention programs. This review compares the differences in biomechanical characteristics between female and male runners. Electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched in December 2021 for studies evaluating sex-specific differences in lower limb mechanics of healthy participants during running. Two independent reviewers determined the inclusion and quality of each research paper. Meta-analyses were used where possible. A total of 13 studies were selected. Means and standard deviations of reported data were retrieved from each selected paper for comparison of results. Three biomechanical variables, including dynamics, muscle activation, and kinematics, were compared between female and male runners. However, no differences were found in kinetic variables or muscle activation between groups due to insufficient data available from the selected studies. Meta-analyses of kinematic variables revealed that female runners exhibited significantly greater hip flexion angle, hip adduction angle, and hip internal rotation angle, but smaller knee flexion angle compared to male runners during running. We found significant differences in kinematic variables between female and male runners, which could influence the training advice of physical therapists and athletic trainers who work with runners, and inform the development of injury prevention programs.

AB  - We examined the effects of side-dominance on the laterality of standing stability using ground reaction force, motion capture (MoCap), and EMG data in healthy young adults. We recruited participants with strong right (n = 15) and left (n = 9) hand and leg dominance (side-dominance). They stood on one or two legs on a pair of synchronized force platforms for 50 s with 60 s rest between three randomized stance trials. In addition to 23 CoP-related variables, we also computed six MoCap variables representing each lower-limb joint motion time series. Moreover, 39 time- and frequency-domain features of EMG data from five muscles in three muscle groups were analyzed. Data from the multitude of biosignals converged and revealed concordant patterns: no differences occurred between left- and right-side dominant participants in kinetic, kinematic, or EMG outcomes during bipedal stance. Regarding single leg stance, larger knee but lower ankle joint kinematic values appeared in left vs right-sided participants during non-dominant stance. Left-vs right-sided participants also had lower medial gastrocnemius EMG activation during non-dominant stance. While right-side dominant participants always produced larger values for kinematic data of ankle joint and medial gastrocnemius EMG activation during non-dominant vs dominant unilateral stance, this pattern was the opposite for left-sided participants, showing larger values when standing on their dominant vs non-dominant leg, i.e., participants had a more stable balance when standing on their right leg. Our results suggest that side-dominance affects biomechanical and neuromuscular control strategies during unilateral standing.

AB  - Although running has many benefits for both the physical and mental health, it also involves the risk of injuries which results in negative physical, psychological and economical consequences. Those injuries are often linked to specific running biomechanical parameters such as the pressure pattern of the foot while running, and they could potentially be indicative for future injuries. Previous studies focus solely on some specific type of running injury and are often only applicable to a gender or running-experience specific population. The purpose of this study is, for both male and female, first-year students, (i) to predict the development of a lower extremity overuse injury in the next 6 months based on foot pressure measurements from a pressure plate and (ii) to identify the predictive loading features. For the first objective, we developed a machine learning pipeline that analyzes foot pressure measurements and predicts whether a lower extremity overuse injury is likely to occur with an AUC of 0.639 and a Brier score of 0.201. For the second objective, we found that the higher pressures exerted on the forefoot are the most predictive for lower extremity overuse injuries and that foot areas from both the lateral and the medial side are needed. Furthermore, there are two kinds of predictive features: the angle of the FFT coefficients and the coefficients of the autoregressive AR process. However, these features are not interpretable in terms of the running biomechanics, limiting its practical use for injury prevention.

AB  - There are still few portable methods for monitoring lower limb joint coordination during the cutting movements (CM). This study aims to obtain the relevant motion biomechanical parameters of the lower limb joints at 90°, 135°, and 180° CM by collecting IMU data of the human lower limbs, and utilizing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural-network framework to predict the coordination variability of selected lower extremity couplings at the three CM directions. There was a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the three couplings during the swing, especially at 90° vs the other directions. At 135° and 180°, t13-he coordination variability of couplings was significantly greater than at 90° (p < 0.001). It is important to note that the coordination variability of Hip rotation/Knee flexion-extension was significantly higher at 90° than at 180° (p < 0.001). By the LSTM, the CM coordination variability for 90° (CMC = 0.99063, RMSE = 0.02358), 135° (CMC = 0.99018, RMSE = 0.02465) and 180° (CMC = 0.99485, RMSE = 0.01771) were accurately predicted. The predictive model could be used as a reliable tool for predicting the coordination variability of different CM directions in patients or athletes and real-world open scenarios using inertial sensors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Rates of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture in young people have increased markedly over the past two decades, with females experiencing greater growth in their risk compared to males. In this study, we determined the effects of low- and high-support athletic footwear on ACL loads during a standardized drop–land–lateral jump in 23 late-/post-pubertal females. Each participant performed the task unshod, wearing low- (Zaraca, ASICS) or high- (Kayano, ASICS) support shoes (in random order), and three-dimensional body motions, ground-reaction forces, and surface electromyograms were synchronously acquired. These data were then used in a validated computational model of ACL loading. One-dimensional statistical parametric mapping paired t-tests were used to compare ACL loads between footwear conditions during the stance phase of the task. Participants generated lower ACL forces during push-off when shod (Kayano: 624 N at 71–84% of stance; Zaraca: 616 N at 68–86% of stance) compared to barefoot (770 N and 740 N, respectively). No significant differences in ACL force were observed between the task performed wearing low- compared to high-support shoes. Compared to barefoot, both shoe types significantly lowered push-off phase peak ACL forces, potentially lowering risk of ACL injury during performance of similar tasks in sport and recreation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether high or low adiposity is associated with youth sport-related injury.Data Sources: Ten electronic databases were searched to identify prospective studies examining the association between adiposity [body mass index (BMI) or body fat] and a future time-loss or medical attention sport-related musculoskeletal injury or concussion in youth aged 20 years and younger. Two independent raters assessed the quality (Downs and Black criteria) and risk of bias (Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool). Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] of injury.Main Results: Of 11 424 potentially relevant records, 38 articles were included with 17 eligible for meta-analyses. In qualitative synthesis, no clear association was identified between adiposity and any sport injury; however, 16/22 studies identified high adiposity as a significant risk factor for lower-extremity injury. Meta-analyses revealed higher BMI in youth with any sport-related injury and lower BMI in youth who developed a bone stress injury (BSI) compared with noninjured controls. The pooled OR (95% CI) examining the association of BMI and injury risk (excluding bone injury) was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.03-1.34). A major source of bias in included articles was inconsistent adjustment for age, sex, and physical activity participation.Conclusions: Level 2b evidence suggests that high BMI is associated with greater risk of youth sport injury, particularly lower-extremity injury and excluding BSI or fracture. Although pooled mean differences were low, anthropometric risk of injury seems to be dependent on type and site of injury in youth sport. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To explore the differences between the result of static optimization (SO) and computational muscle control (CMC) algorithms for estimating muscle forces, so as to provide references for researchers to choose the appropriate algorithm and make horizontal comparison of the results from different studies. Methods: Targeting at a single gait cycle running at four different speeds, SO and CMC algorithms were used to calculate forces and activations of the major muscles in lower limbs, and the results were compared and analyzed. Results: Among the 10 major muscles participating in running, except for anterior tibial and rectus femoris, muscle forces and muscle activations solved by the two algorithms had similar curves with correlation coefficients more than 0.91, and the peak value of muscle forces solved by SO was higher and the positions of peak muscle activation had a 10 ms delay. Conclusions: In movement analysis, if the research focuses on the timing of muscle forces and the contribution ratios among different muscles, there is not too big difference and SO algorithm is recommended for its simplicity and efficiency. For horizontal comparison of muscle forces and muscle activations estimated by SO and CMC algorithms in different studies, the differences between the two algorithms should be considered.

AB  - This paper presents a sensor-guided gait-synchronization system to help potential unilateral knee-injured people walk normally with a weight-supported lower-extremity-exoskeleton (LEE). This relieves the body weight loading on the knee-injured leg and synchronizes its motion with that of the healthy leg during the swing phase of walking. The sensor-guided gait-synchronization system is integrated with a body sensor network designed to sense the motion/gait of the healthy leg. Guided by the measured joint-angle trajectories, the motorized hip joint lifts the links during walking and synchronizes the knee-injured gait with the healthy gait by a half-cycle delay. The effectiveness of the LEE is illustrated experimentally. We compare the measured joint-angle trajectories between the healthy and knee-injured legs, the simulated knee forces, and the human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The results indicate that the motorized hip-controlled LEE can synchronize the motion/gait of the combined body-weight-supported LEE and injured leg with that of the healthy leg. © 2022, Zhejiang University Press.

AB  - Background: Bone stress injury (BSI) is a common reason for missed practices and competitions in elite track and field runners. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that, after accounting for medical risk factors, higher plantar loading during running, walking, and athletic movements would predict the risk of future BSI in elite collegiate runners. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 39 elite collegiate runners (24 male, 15 female) were evaluated during the 2014-2015 academic year to determine the degree to which plantar pressure data and medical history (including Female and Male Athlete Triad risk factors) could predict subsequent BSI. Runners completed athletic movements while plantar pressures and contact areas in 7 key areas of the foot were recorded, and the measurements were reported overall and by specific foot area. Regression models were constructed to determine factors related to incident BSI. Results: Twenty-one runners (12 male, 9 female) sustained ≥1 incident BSI during the study period. Four regression models incorporating both plantar pressure measurements and medical risk factors were able to predict the subsequent occurrence of (A) BSIs in female runners, (B) BSIs in male runners, (C) multiple BSIs in either male or female runners, and (D) foot BSIs in female runners. Model A used maximum mean pressure (MMP) under the first metatarsal during a jump takeoff and only misclassified 1 female with no BSI. Model B used increased impulses under the hindfoot and second through fifth distal metatarsals while walking, and under the lesser toes during a cutting task, correctly categorizing 83.3% of male runners. Model C used higher medial midfoot peak pressure during a shuttle run and triad cumulative risk scores and correctly categorized 93.3% of runners who did not incur multiple BSIs and 66.7% of those who did. Model D included lower hindfoot impulses in the shuttle run and higher first metatarsal MMP during treadmill walking to correctly predict the subsequent occurrence of a foot BSI for 75% of women and 100% without. Conclusion: The models collectively suggested that higher plantar pressure may contribute to risk for BSI. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Little is known about the construct validity of the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). We aimed to assess associations between FMS task scores and measures of maximum joint range-of-motion (ROM) among university varsity student-athletes from 4 sports (volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, and soccer). Athletes performed FMS tasks and had their maximum ankle, hip and shoulder ROM measured. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate associations between FMS task scores and ROM measurements. 101 university student-athletes were recruited (52 W/49 M; mean age 20.4±1.9 years). In general, athletes with higher FMS task scores had greater ROM compared to those with lower task scores. For example, athletes who scored 2 on the FMS squat task had 4° (95% CI, 1° to 7°) more uni-articular ankle dorsiflexion ROM compared with those who scored 1, while those who scored 3 on the FMS squat task had 10° (4° to 17°) more uni-articular ankle dorsiflexion ROM compared with those who scored 1. Large variation in ROM measurements was observed. In sum, substantial overlap in joint ROM between groups of athletes with different FMS task scores weakens the construct validity of the FMS as an indicator of specific joint ROM. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) are a significant burden on the military healthcare system. Movement strategies, genetics, and fitness level have been identified as potential contributors to MSKI risk. Screening measures associated with MSKI risk are emerging, including novel technologies, such as markerless motion capture (mMoCap) and force plates (FP) and allow for field expedient measures in dynamic military settings. The aim of the current study was to evaluate movement strategies (i.e., describe variables) of the countermovement jump (CMJ) in Marine officer candidates (MOCs) via mMoCap and FP technology by clustering variables to create distinct movement strategies associated with MSKI sustained during Officer Candidates School (OCS). 728 MOCs were tested and 668 MOCs (Male MOCs = 547, Female MOCs = 121) were used for analysis. MOCs performed 3 maximal CMJs in a mMoCap space with FP embedded into the system. De-identified MSKI data was acquired from internal OCS reports for those who presented to the OCS Physical Therapy department for MSKI treatment during the 10 weeks of OCS training. Three distinct clusters were formed with variables relating to CMJ kinetics and kinematics from the mMoCap and FPs. Proportions of MOCs with a lower extremity and torso MSKI across clusters were significantly different (p < 0.001), with the high-risk cluster having the highest proportions (30.5%), followed by moderate-risk cluster (22.5%) and low-risk cluster (13.8%). Kinetics, including braking rate of force development (BRFD), braking net impulse and propulsive net impulse, were higher in low-risk cluster compared to the high-risk cluster (p < 0.001). Lesser degrees of flexion and shorter CMJ phase durations (braking phase and propulsive phase) were observed in low-risk cluster compared to both moderate-risk and high-risk clusters. Male MOCs were distributed equally across clusters while female MOCs were primarily distributed in the high-risk cluster. Movement strategies (i.e., clusters), as quantified by mMoCap and FPs, were successfully described with MOCs MSKI risk proportions between clusters. These results provide actionable thresholds of key performance indicators for practitioners to use for screening measures in classifying greater MSKI risk. These tools may add value in creating modifiable strength and conditioning training programs before or during military training.

AB  - Wearable technologies are often indicated as tools that can enable the in-field collection of quantitative biomechanical data, unobtrusively, for extended periods of time, and with few spatial limitations. Despite many claims about their potential for impact in the area of injury prevention and management, there seems to be little attention to grounding this potential in biomechanical research linking quantities from wearables to musculoskeletal injuries, and to assessing the readiness of these biomechanical approaches for being implemented in real practice. We performed a systematic scoping review to characterise and critically analyse the state of the art of research using wearable technologies to study musculoskeletal injuries in sport from a biomechanical perspective. A total of 4952 articles were retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases; 165 were included. Multiple study features—such as research design, scope, experimental settings, and applied context—were summarised and assessed. We also proposed an injury-research readiness classification tool to gauge the maturity of biomechanical approaches using wearables. Five main conclusions emerged from this review, which we used as a springboard to propose guidelines and good practices for future research and dissemination in the field. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable activity recognition can collate the type, intensity, and duration of each child's physical activity profile, which is important for exploring underlying adolescent health mechanisms. Traditional machine-learning-based approaches require large labeled data sets; however, child activity data sets are typically small and insufficient. Thus, we proposed a transfer learning approach that adapts adult-domain data to train a high-fidelity, subject-independent model for child activity recognition. Twenty children and twenty adults wore an accelerometer wristband while performing walking, running, sitting, and rope skipping activities. Activity classification accuracy was determined via the traditional machine learning approach without transfer learning and with the proposed subject-independent transfer learning approach. Results showed that transfer learning increased classification accuracy to 91.4% as compared to 80.6% without transfer learning. These results suggest that subject-independent transfer learning can improve accuracy and potentially reduce the size of the required child data sets to enable physical activity monitoring systems to be adopted more widely, quickly, and economically for children and provide deeper insights into injury prevention and health promotion strategies. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This work presents a survey literature review on biomechanics, specifically aimed at the study of existent biomechanical tools through video analysis, in order to identify opportunities for researchers in the field, and discuss future proposals and perspectives. Scientific literature (journal papers and conference proceedings) in the field of video-based biomechanics published after 2010 were selected and discussed. The most common application of the study of biomechanics using this technique is sports, where the most reported applications are american football, soccer, basketball, baseball, jumping, among others. These techniques have also been studied in a less proportion, in ergonomy, and injury prevention. From the revised literature, it is clear that biomechanics studies mainly focus on the analysis of angles, speed or acceleration, however, not many studies explore the dynamical forces in the joints. The development of video-based biomechanic tools for force analysis could provide methods for assessment and prediction of biomechanical force associated risks such as injuries and fractures. Therefore, it is convenient to start exploring this field. A few case studies are reported, where force estimation is performed via manual tracking in different scenarios. This demonstration is carried out using conventional manual tracking, however, the inclusion of similar methods in an automated manner could help in the development of intelligent healthcare, force prediction tools for athletes and/or elderly population. Future trends and challenges in this field are also discussed, where data availability and artificial intelligence models will be key to proposing new and more reliable methods for biomechanical analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used to monitor running biomechanics in real-world settings, but IMUs are often used within a laboratory. The purpose of this scoping review was to describe how IMUs are used to record running biomechanics in both laboratory and real-world conditions. We included peer-reviewed journal articles that used IMUs to assess gait quality during running. We extracted data on running conditions (indoor/outdoor, surface, speed, and distance), device type and location, metrics, participants, and purpose and study design. A total of 231 studies were included. Most (72%) studies were conducted indoors; and in 67% of all studies, the analyzed distance was only one step or stride or <200 m. The most common device type and location combination was a triaxial accelerometer on the shank (18% of device and location combinations). The most common analyzed metric was vertical/axial magnitude, which was reported in 64% of all studies. Most studies (56%) included recreational runners. For the past 20 years, studies using IMUs to record running biomechanics have mainly been conducted indoors, on a treadmill, at prescribed speeds, and over small distances. We suggest that future studies should move out of the lab to less controlled and more real-world environments. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to gather information that would motivate researchers, prosthetic development engineers, and health care providers to expand the emphasis on functional mobility, activity, and exercise that prosthetic users perform in real-world settings. Intuitive measures of daily activity performed in-tandem with laboratory assessments could provide a more complete perspective of functional performance. Recent Findings: The use of wearable sensors to assess prosthetic use has gained traction in the recent decade and can provide ecologically valid real-world mobility and activity data. This knowledge can be used to promote exercise and develop interventions that may mitigate the comorbidities related to limb loss. Not all wearable sensors perform well on prosthetic users, and sample periods (usually 7 days) are probably too short. High tech watches from major manufacturers still have substantial errors in estimating heart rate and energy expenditure across a range of intensities, but upgrades are occurring frequently. Summary: Objective metrics that quantify real-world mobility and activity provide a unique perspective that compliments laboratory and survey outcomes to better inform on the effectiveness of prosthetic interventions. However, choosing an appropriate sensor that is valid and sensitive is critical to capture meaningful outcomes and requires careful consideration of the activity of interest and the effects of different prosthetic prescriptions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Markerless motion capture systems are promising for the assessment of movement in more real world research and clinical settings. While the technology has come a long way in the last 20 years, it is important for researchers and clinicians to understand the capacities and considerations for implementing these types of systems. The current review provides a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis related to the successful adoption of markerless motion capture technology for the assessment of lower-limb musculoskeletal kinematics in sport medicine and performance settings. 31 articles met the a priori inclusion criteria of this analysis. Findings from the analysis indicate that the improving accuracy of these systems via the refinement of machine learning algorithms, combined with their cost efficacy and the enhanced ecological validity outweighs the current weaknesses and threats. Further, the analysis makes clear that there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration between sport scientists and computer vision scientists to develop accurate clinical and research applications that are specific to sport. While work remains to be done for broad application, markerless motion capture technology is currently on a positive trajectory and the data from this analysis provide an efficient roadmap toward widespread adoption.

AB  - The aim of this pilot study was to analyze the potential association of a novel multifactorial hamstring screening protocol with the occurrence of hamstring muscle injuries (HMI) in professional football. 161 professional male football players participated in this study (age: 24.6 ± 5.36 years; body-height: 180 ± 7.07 cm; body-mass: 77.2 ± 7.70 kg). During the pre- and mid-season, players performed a screening protocol consisting of 11 tests aimed to evaluate their performance in regards to four main musculoskeletal categories: posterior chain strength, sprint mechanical output, lumbopelvic control and range of motion. Univariable cox regression analysis showed no significant association between the isolated test results and new HMI occurrence during the season (n = 17) (p > 0.05). When including injuries that took place between the pre- and mid-season screenings (~90 days), maximal theoretical horizontal force (F0) was significantly associated with higher HMI risk between pre- and mid-season evaluations (n = 14, hazard ratio; 4.02 (CI95% 1.08 to 15.0, p = 0.04). This study identified that 1) no single screening test was sufficient to identify players at risk of HMI within the entire season, while 2) low F0 was associated with increased risk of HMI when occurring closer to the moment of screening. The present results support the potential relevance of additionally including frequent F0 testing for HMI risk reduction management. Replication studies are needed in larger cohorts for more accurate interpretations on “univariable and multivariable levels levels. Finally, future studies should explore whether improving F0 is relevant within a multifactorial HMI risk reduction approach. © 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Running gait assessment has traditionally been performed using subjective observation or expensive laboratory-based objective technologies, such as three-dimensional motion capture or force plates. However, recent developments in wearable devices allow for continuous monitoring and analysis of running mechanics in any environment. Objective measurement of running gait is an important (clinical) tool for injury assessment and provides measures that can be used to enhance performance. Objectives: We aimed to systematically review the available literature investigating how wearable technology is being used for running gait analysis in adults. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the following scientific databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus. Information was extracted from each included article regarding the type of study, participants, protocol, wearable device(s), main outcomes/measures, analysis and key findings. Results: A total of 131 articles were reviewed: 56 investigated the validity of wearable technology, 22 examined the reliability and 77 focused on applied use. Most studies used inertial measurement units (n = 62) [i.e. a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers in a single unit] or solely accelerometers (n = 40), with one using gyroscopes alone and 31 using pressure sensors. On average, studies used one wearable device to examine running gait. Wearable locations were distributed among the shank, shoe and waist. The mean number of participants was 26 (± 27), with an average age of 28.3 (± 7.0) years. Most studies took place indoors (n = 93), using a treadmill (n = 62), with the main aims seeking to identify running gait outcomes or investigate the effects of injury, fatigue, intrinsic factors (e.g. age, sex, morphology) or footwear on running gait outcomes. Generally, wearables were found to be valid and reliable tools for assessing running gait compared to reference standards. Conclusions: This comprehensive review highlighted that most studies that have examined running gait using wearable sensors have done so with young adult recreational runners, using one inertial measurement unit sensor, with participants running on a treadmill and reporting outcomes of ground contact time, stride length, stride frequency and tibial acceleration. Future studies are required to obtain consensus regarding terminology, protocols for testing validity and the reliability of devices and suitability of gait outcomes.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has given a new dimension to the sport and mentality of soccer by tracking and planning the path of soccer and analyzing the learning process. Along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it is also used in sports events. Soccer, the world's number one ball game, has always received worldwide attention. Although soccer is full of realism, it does not mean that its behavior cannot be predicted. By taking advantage of the role of artificial intelligence, model data from training is used to perform a deeper analysis of the correlated role of a soccer team's players in the game, which is very helpful to improve the team's training efficiency and tactics. As an emerging intelligent algorithm, the improved genetic algorithm can seek the global optimal solution based on the results of the algorithm execution and apply it to the planning of soccer training paths, which has a strong application value for improving the team's training level and helping the team to formulate reasonable and effective offensive and defensive strategies. In this paper, we use artificial intelligence as the research background to improve the genetic algorithm by extracting the soccer training function and apply the improved algorithm to the soccer training path planning to get the global optimal solution, so as to help the players find the reasonable and effective optimal path of passing or shooting and help the team to build the tactical planning and winning strategy of offense and defense to meet the earnest expectation of soccer fans. © 2022 Weiwei Zhang.

AB  - In this paper, 1,538 papers retrieved with the keywords 'sports artificial intelligence (AI)' on the Web of Science database since 2007 were taken as the data source, and the Cite Space V software was used to visualize and analyze them. A visual knowledge graph was used to streamline the countries, institutions and authors conducting sports AI research, discipline distribution, research hotspots and development trends in the past 15 years. Subsequently, its development direction and research progress were discussed. Sports AI was widely distributed, with the US, China and the UK leading the way. The most prolific authors and teams in research on sports AI were concentrated in American universities. Their main research direction is to develop and improve smart wearable devices based on machine learning and deep learning technologies for different groups of people. Research on sports AI involved multiple disciplines, which mainly applied and referred to research methodologies and theories on engineering, computer science and sports science. It could be seen from the frequency and centrality of keywords that in the current field of sports AI, machine learning is the main direction, artificial neural networks is the main algorithm, and practical and empirical research based on data mining is the focus. The research hotspots were divided into three major clusters: physical health promotion, sports injury prevention and control, and athletic performance enhancement. How to introduce intelligent technology into sports for a perfect integration still has an arduous and long way to go. Future development requires joint efforts and participation of scientific researchers, professionals and common people. © 2022 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In injury prevention, a vertical drop jump (DJ) is often used for screening athletes at risk for injury; however, the large variation in individual movement patterns might mask potentially relevant strategies when analysed on a group-based level. Two movement strategies are commonly discussed as predisposing athletes to ACL injuries: a deficient leg axis and increased leg stiffness during landing. This study investigated the individual movement pattern of 39 female and male competitive soccer players performing DJs at rest and after being fatigued. The joint angles were used to train a Kohonen self-organising map. Out of 19,596 input vectors, the SOM identified 700 unique postures. Visualising the movement trajectories and adding the latent parameters contact time, medial knee displacement (MKD) and knee abduction moment allow identification of zones with presumably increased injury risk and whether the individual movement patterns pass these zones. This information can be used, e.g., for individual screening and for feedback purposes. Additionally, an athlete’s reaction to fatigue can be explored by comparing the rested and fatigued movement trajectories. The results highlight the ability of unsupervised learning to visualise movement patterns and to give further insight into an individual athlete’s status without the necessity of a priori assumptions. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In order to solve the problem of sports medical image in basketball training, a sports medical image modeling research method based on injury prevention in basketball training was proposed. By the method, the current situation of sports injury in university basketball was investigated. At the same time, the injury factors were analyzed on four occasions, including basketball class, extracurricular activities, competition, and training. In order to reduce the occurrence of injury and enhance the security of basketball sports for nonbasketball students of physical education, combined with the problems and reasons, the corresponding suggestions were put forward. Through the experiment, it was found that the incidence of basketball injury for nonbasketball male university students was as high as 90.7%. The results of the experiment showed that it was necessary to enhance the awareness of self-protection, control emotions and exhibitionism, strengthen physical training, attach importance to basic skills training, do warm-up activities, stay focused, pay attention to exercise load, and prevent excessive fatigue. © 2022 Wenjie E. et al.

AB  - This review aimed to gives a modern information about possibilities of motion capture sys-tems in sport medicine. Biomechanical analysis of movements is an important tool for preventing sports injuries and evaluating the rehabilitation effectiveness Available technologies for locomo-tor functions study are discussed briefly: recording principles, advantages and disadvantages of optoelectronic, electromagnetic, inertial and ultrasonic measuring systems are outlined. Ap-proaches to the motion capture systems selection based on the sport form (team or individual), study character (indoors or outdoors) and specific sports movements are discussed. The role of motion capture in the clarification of origin mechanisms for sport injuries in various sports are considered. It is shown how the motion capture allows to control the processes of recovery after injuries and surgical interventions. The review demonstrates that motion capture technologies in sports have significant prospects, since they allow timely obtaining comprehensive information about the physical condition of an athlete and the features of his motor stereotypes. The motion capture data analysis allow to improve the organization of the training process for achieving higher sports results, to detect the reasons for sports injuries in order to prevent them, to access the physical rehabilitation results, to define the criteria for return to sport after injuries. © PNRPU

AB  - Identifying players or circumstances associated with an increased risk of injury is fundamental for successful risk management in football. So far, time-constant and volatile risk factors are generally considered separately in either a screening (constant) or a monitoring (volatile) approach each resulting in a restricted set of explanatory variables. Consequently, improvements in predictive accuracy may be expected when screening and monitoring data are combined, especially when analysed with current machine learning (ML) techniques. This trial was designed as a prospective observational cohort study aiming to forecast non-contact time-loss injuries in male professional football (soccer). Injuries were registered according to the Fuller consensus. Gradient boosting with ROSE upsampling within a leave-one-out cross-validation was used for data analysis. The hierarchical data structure was considered throughout. Different splits of the original dataset were used to probe the robustness of results. Data of 88 players from 4 teams and 51 injuries could be analysed. The cross-validated performance of the gradient boosted model (ROC area under the curve 0.61) was promising and higher compared to models without integration of screening data. Importantly, holdout test set performance was similar (ROC area under the curve 0.62) indicating prospect of generalizability to new cases. However, the variation of predictive accuracy and feature importance with different splits of the original dataset reflects the relatively low number of events. It is concluded that ML-based injury forecasting based on the integration of screening and monitoring data is promising. However, external prospective verification and continued model development are required. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Modifiable (biomechanical and neuromuscular) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk factors have been identified in laboratory settings. These risk factors were subsequently used in ACL injury prevention measures. Due to the lack of ecological validity, the use of on-field data in the ACL injury risk screening is increasingly advocated. Though, the kinematic differences between laboratory and on-field settings have never been investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lower-limb kinematics of female footballers during agility movements performed both in laboratory and football field environments. Twenty-eight healthy young female talented football (soccer) players (14.9 ± 0.9 years) participated. Lower-limb joint kinematics was collected through wearable inertial sensors (Xsens Link) in three conditions: (1) laboratory setting during unanticipated sidestep cutting at 40-50°; on the football pitch (2) football-specific exercises (F-EX) and (3) football games (F-GAME). A hierarchical two-level random effect model in Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to compare joint kinematics among the conditions. Waveform consistency was investigated through Pearson’s correlation coefficient and standardized z-score vector. In-lab kinematics differed from the on-field ones, while the latter were similar in overall shape and peaks. Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found for on-field kinematics (p < 0.044). The largest differences were found during landing and weight acceptance. The biomechanical differences between lab and field settings suggest the application of context-related adaptations in female footballers and have implications in ACL injury prevention strategies. Highlights Talented youth female football players showed kinematical differences between the lab condition and the on-field ones, thus adopting a context-related motor strategy. Lower sagittal plane range of motion, greater ankle eversion, and pelvic rotation were found on the field. Such differences pertain to the ACL injury mechanism and prevention strategies. Preventative training should support the adoption of non-linear motor learning to stimulate greater self-organization and adaptability. It is recommended to test football players in an ecological environment to improve subsequent primary ACL injury prevention programmes. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.

AB  - Introduction: Basketball is a popular sport globally, and as the development of college basketball develops, basketball injuries also tend to increase. The knee has the highest injuries and problems incidence, reducing the athlete’s ability and shortening their professional career. Objective: Explore the causes and characteristics of knee joint injuries in basketball players, comparing their different levels, performances, and positions. Methods: 600 college basketball players were studied. Current and past injuries were collected. A questionnaire on lifestyle, behavior, and habits was also applied, and their levels of physical ability and knowledge were also evaluated. Statistical methods were employed to investigate the characteristics and causes of knee joint injuries in young athletes. Results: Among knee joint injuries of adolescent basketball players, there were more medial collateral ligament injuries and meniscal injuries. The probabilities are 34.1% and 24.3%, respectively. Patellar strain and cruciate ligament injury accounted for 12.1% and 19.5%, respectively, and the probability of fracture injury was 2.4%. Conclusion: The knee joint is one of the most vulnerable joints in basketball. The consequences of its injury can bring an athletic career down and have a considerable impact on athletes’ physical and mental health.

AB  - This study synthesizes the relevant publications on the therapy of horizontal joint destabilization of the functional ankle and investigates the effect of anterior motion ankle drills on the inability to cause ankle injuries in soccer teams. We chose university soccer teams as the study population and divided them into five men's and five women's squads and five control groups. Embedded microcontrollers are also called microcontrollers. Generally, we focus on a specific type of microprocessor center, integrating ROM/EPROM, RAM, Bus Logic, Timer/Counter, Watchdog, I/O, Serial Port, Pulse Width Modulation Output, A/D, D/A, and more. Functions and Devices. Representative embedded microcontrollers include PSIXA, 8051, MCS-251, MCS96/196/296, and C166/167. With the continuous improvement of the processor's computing power and chip integration, the differences between embedded microprocessors and embedded microprocessors have further increased. Blurred. The test subjects experienced force testing and the trial subjects involved in ankle native sensory drilling. The experimental results show that the average direction has a statistically significant effect on the front, back, left, and right running ability, which increases significantly after 0.017, 0.032, and 0.043 P, respectively, providing a more scientific basis for preventing football injuries. © 2022 Siwen Li.

AB  - Athletes typically undergo regular evaluations by trainers and coaches to assess performance and injury risk. One of the most popular movements to examine in athletes needing lower extremity strength and power is the vertical jump. Specifically, maximal effort countermovement and drop jumps performed on bilateral force plates provide a wealth of metrics. However, the expense of the equipment and expertise needed to interpret the results limits their use. Computer vision techniques applied to videos of such movements are a less expensive alternative for extracting complementary metrics. Blanchard et al. [4] collected a dataset of 89 athletes performing these movements and showcased how OpenPose could be applied to the data. However, athlete error calls into question 46.2% of movements - in these cases, an expert assessor would have the athlete redo the movement to eliminate the error. Here, we augmented [4] with expert labels of error and established benchmark performance on automatic error identification. In total, 14 different types of errors were identified by trained annotators. Our benchmark models identified errors with an F1 score of 0.710 and a Kappa of 0.457 (Kappa measures accuracy over chance). All code and augmented labels can be found at https://blanchard-lab.github.io/apev.github.io/. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable technologies are emerging as a useful tool with many different applications. While these devices are worn on the human body and can capture numerous data types, this literature review focuses specifically on wearable use for performance enhancement and risk assessment in industrial-and sports-related biomechanical applications. Wearable devices such as exoskeletons, inertial measurement units (IMUs), force sensors, and surface electromyography (EMG) were identified as key technologies that can be used to aid health and safety professionals, ergonomists, and human factors practitioners improve user performance and monitor risk. IMU-based solutions were the most used wearable types in both sectors. Industry largely used biomechanical wearables to assess tasks and risks wholistically, which sports often considered the individual components of movement and performance. Availability, cost, and adoption remain common limitation issues across both sports and industrial applications. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion represents one of the most dramatic sport injuries. Even though clinical screenings aiming at identifying subjects at risk of injuries are gaining popularity, the use of sophisticated equipment still represents a barrier towards their widespread use. This study aimed to test both reliability and repeatability of a new methodology to assess lower limb joints kinematics and kinetics directly on field with the aid of video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Ten athletes and one case study (post ACL surgery) were assessed in a gait laboratory, while performing double leg squats, through the simultaneous acquisition of stereophotogrammetry, force plates, commercial video cameras and plantar pressure insoles. Different sources of errors were investigated and both reliability and repeatability analysis performed. Minimum and maximum RMSE values of 0.74% (right knee joint center trajectory) and 64.51%, respectively (ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment), were detected. Excellent to good correlation was found for the majority of the measures, even though very poor and inverse between-trials correlation was found on a restricted number of trials especially for the ankle dorsi-plantarflexion moment. These findings could be used in combination with already available screening tools in order to provide more repeatable results. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The best predictor of future injury is previous injury and this has not changed in a quarter century despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Regardless of formal care, these athletes remain two to four times more likely to suffer a second injury for several years after RTP. In the case of children and young adults, this sets them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. Thus, the initial injury is the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs, and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. This chapter details the technologies and method that make up the automated Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP3)—a revolutionary new approach to the current standard of post-injury care that identifies and targets deficits that underly second injury risk in sport. IP3 capitalizes on the biological concept of phenotypic plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments, and it is implemented in two distinct steps: (1) phenomic profiling and (2) precision treatment. Phenomic profiling indexes the fitness and subsequent phenotypic plasticity of an individual athlete, which drives the personalization of the precision treatment step. IP3 leverages mixed-reality technologies to present true-to-life environments that test the athlete’s ability to adapt to dynamic stressors. The athlete’s phenotypic plasticity profile is then used to drive a precision treatment that systematically stresses the athlete, via a combination of behavioral-based and genetic fuzzy system models, to optimally enhance the athlete’s functional adaptability. IP3 is computationally light-weight and, through the integration with mixed-reality technologies, promotes real-time prediction, responsiveness, and adaptation. It is also the first ever phenotypic plasticity-based precision medicine platform, and the first precision sports medicine platform of any kind. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Pathological conditions with ongoing inflammatory processes result in specific heat signatures at the affected body parts; infrared thermography (IRT) detects these changes and can be utilied in screening such conditions. The modern devices are advanced and their non contact, convenient and precise readings can aid in multiple medical sub fields. Orthopaedics as a broad entity has witnessed utilisation of this technology for different indications and the present scoping review was done to assess these established indications and further scope of its utility. Method: ology: A Medline search was done on April 26, 2021 with specific keywords for studies of any design in English language discussing the usage of thermography in Orthopaedics. Animal studies, conference abstracts, systematic reviews, e-posters, case reports, book chapters, and studies describing the use of thermography in non-Orthopaedic patients were excluded. Results: Total number of hits were 1380. 43 studies including case series and case control studies were included in the review. The subfields or indications described were pain/arthritis, Charcot's foot/neuropathic ulcers, infections associated with diabetic feet and arthroplasties, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, carpal tunnel syndrome, sports medicine, paediatric orthopaedics, spine, ergonomics and compartment syndrome. Conclusion: IRT has been described to be effective in orthopaedic conditions with specific heat signatures and this can assess the trend of the ongoing inflammatory process as well as response to a particular treatment. Additionally, it can specifically determine the exact loci of the pathology for targeted interventions. © 2021

AB  - Among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), the two common strategies for decreasing peak plantar pressure (PPP) to reduce diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) risks are to modify walking speeds and to change insole materials. This study reviewed the PPP reduction based on various walking speeds and insole materials. The articles were retrieved from four major scientific databases and manual search. We identified 1585 articles, of which 27 articles were selected for full-text analysis. We found that in faster walking speeds, the forefoot PPP was higher (308 kPa) than midfoot (150 kPa) and rearfoot (251 kPa) PPP. The appropriate walking speed for reducing the forefoot PPP was about 6 km/h for non-DM and 4 km/h for DM people. The forefoot PPP in DM people was 185% higher than that of non-DM people. Ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) insole material was the most popular material used by experts (26%) in the forefoot and reduced 37% of PPP. In conclusion, the suitable walking speed for DM was slower than for non-DM people, and EVA was the most common insole material used to decrease the PPP under the forefoot. The clinicians might recommend DM people to walk at 4 km/h and wear EVA insole material to minimize the DFUs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Predicting and avoiding an injury is a challenging task. By exploiting data mining techniques, this paper aims to identify existing relationships between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, with the final goal of predicting non-contact injuries. Twenty-three young soccer players were monitored during an entire season, with a total of fifty-seven non-contact injuries identified. Anthropometric data were collected, and the maturity offset was calculated for each player. To quantify internal training/match load and recovery status of the players, we daily employed the session-RPE method and the total quality recovery (TQR) scale. Cumulative workloads and the acute: chronic workload ratio (ACWR) were calculated. To explore the relationship between the various risk factors and the onset of non-contact injuries, we performed a classification tree analysis. The classification tree model exhibited an acceptable discrimination (AUC=0.76), after receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. A low state of recovery, a rapid increase in the training load, cumulative workload, and maturity offset were recognized by the data mining algorithm as the most important injury risk factors. © 2021 M.

AB  - The identification of movement strategies in situations that are as ecologically valid as possible is essential for the understanding of lower limb interactions. This study considered the kinetic and kinematic data for the hip, knee and ankle joints from 376 block jump-landings when moving in the dominant and non-dominant directions from fourteen senior national female volleyball players. Two Machine Learning methods were used to generate the models from the dataset, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks. In addition, decision trees were used to detect which variables were relevant to discern the limb movement strategies and to provide a meaningful prediction. The results showed statistically significant differences when comparing the movement strategies between limb role (accuracy > 88.0% and > 89.3%, respectively), and when moving in the different directions but performing the same role (accuracy > 92.3% and > 91.2%, respectively). This highlights the importance of considering limb dominance, limb role and direction of movement during block jump-landings in the identification of which biomechanical variables are the most influential in the movement strategies. Moreover, Machine Learning allows the exploration of how the joints of both limbs interact during sporting tasks, which could provide a greater understanding and identification of risky movements and preventative strategies. All these detailed and valuable descriptions could provide relevant information about how to improve the performance of the players and how to plan trainings in order to avoid an overload that could lead to risk of injury. This highlights that, there is a necessity to consider the learning models, in which the spike approach unilaterally is taught before the block approach (bilaterally). Therefore, we support the idea of teaching bilateral approach before learning the spike, in order to improve coordination and to avoid asymmetries between limbs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Dynamic knee valgus (DKV) malalignment affects the biomechanical characteristic during sports activities. This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate mechanical energy absorption (MEA) strategies at initial contact (IC) and total landing (TL) phases during single-leg landing (SLL), and double-leg landing (DLL). Twenty-eight female athletes with DKV (age 10–14) were invited. MEA analysis of lower extremity joints was done in sagittal and frontal motion planes employing 8 Vicon motion capture cameras and 2 Kistler force plates. Statistical analysis was done using IBM Statistics (version24) by Bivariate Pearson Correlation Coefficient test. Knee extensors MEA during SLL (IC: P = 0.008, R = 0.522/TL: P < 0.001, R = 0.642) and DLL (IC: P < 0.001, R = 0.611/TL: P = 0.011, R = 0.525), and knee abductors during SLL (IC: P = 0.021, R = 0.474) were positively correlated with increased DKV angle. Ankle plantar flexors during SLL (TL: P = 0.017, R = − 0.477) and DLL (TL: P = 0.028, R = − 0.404), and hip extensors during SLL (TL: P = 0.006, R = − 0.5120) were negatively correlated with increased DKV angle. Compensated MEA in knee extensors was correlated with less ankle plantar flexion MEA during SLL (IC: P = 0.027, R = − 0.514/TL: P = 0.007, R = − 0.637) and DLL (IC: P = 0.033, R = − 00.412/TL: P = 0.025, R = − 0.485). These outcomes indicated a knee-reliant MEA strategy in female athletes with DKV during puberty, putting them at higher risks of ACL injuries during landing. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Change of direction movement is common in sports and the ability to perform this complex movement efficiently is related to athlete's performance. Wearable devices have been used to evaluate aspects of change of direction movement, but so far there are no clear recommendations on specific metrics to be used. The aims of this scoping review were to evaluate the reliability and validity of inertial measurement unit sensors to provide information on change of direction movement and to summarize the available evidence on inertial measurement units in analyzing change of direction movement in sports. A systematic search was employed in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO host), SPORTDiscus (EBSCO host), EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science to identify eligible studies. A complementary grey literature search was employed to locate non-peer reviewed studies. The risk of bias of the studies evaluating validity and/or reliability was evaluated using the AXIS tool. The initial search identified 15,165 studies. After duplicate removal and full-text screening 49 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 11 studies evaluating validity and/or reliability. There are promising results on the validity and reliability, but the number of studies is still small and the quality of the studies is limited. Most of the studies were conducted with pre-planned movements and participants were usually adult males. Varying sensor locations limits the ability to generalize these findings. Inertial measurement units (IMU) can be used to detect change of direction (COD) movements and COD heading angles with acceptable validity, but IMU measured or derived kinetic or kinematic variables present inconsistency and over-estimation. Studies can be improved with larger sample sizes and agreement on the metrics used and sensor placement. Future research should include more on-field studies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Given the severe economic and performance implications of hamstring injuries, there are different attempts to identify their risk factors for subsequently developing injury prevention strategies to reduce the risk of these injuries. One of the strategies reported in the scientific literature is the application of interventions with eccentric exercises. To verify the effectiveness of these interventions, different eccentric strength measurements have been used with low-cost devices as alternatives to the widespread used isokinetic dynamometers and the technically limited handheld dynamometers. Therefore, the purpose of the present systematic review was to summarize the findings of the scientific literature related to the evaluation of eccentric strength of hamstring muscles with these new technologies. Methods: Systematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, from inception up to April 2020, were conducted for peer reviewed articles written in English, reporting eccentric strength of hamstrings assessed by devices, different to isokinetic and handheld dynamometers, in athletes. Results: Seventeen studies were finally included in the review with 4 different devices used and 18 parameters identified. The pooled sample consisted of 2893 participants (97% male and 3% female: 22 ± 4 years). The parameters most used were peak force (highest and average), peak torque (average and highest), and between-limb imbalance (left-to-right limb ratio). There is inconsistency regarding the association between eccentric hamstrings strength and both injury risk and athletic performance. There is no standardized definition or standardization of the calculation of the used parameters. Conclusions: The current evidence is insufficient to recommend a practical guide for sports professionals to use these new technologies in their daily routine, due to the need for standardized definitions and calculations. Furthermore, more studies with female athletes are warranted. Despite these limitations, the eccentric strength of hamstring muscles assessed by different devices may be recommended for monitoring the neuromuscular status of athletes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an iterative process by which information is captured, transformed into knowledge and processed to produce adaptive changes in the environment. AI is a broad concept, involving virtual (computing) and physical (robotics) elements. In this narrative literature review, we focus on the aspects of AI that present major opportunities for developing health care. Within a few years, AI will be part of our daily clinical practice. Although significant advances are being made, the application of AI in musculoskeletal medicine is still in its early stages compared with its implementation in other areas of medicine. AI is increasingly being employed in fields such as musculoskeletal radiology, skeletal trauma, orthopedic surgery, physical and rehabilitation medicine and sports medicine, as well as for “big data” and AI in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy related injuries. Among the limitations of IA are that it analyzes information based on the data it is supplied, which must therefore be well-labeled and that some algorithms such as DL uses more time, data, and computational power than other techniques. Moreover, AI currently does not solve the problem of causality that exists in medicine with observational data; information that physicians interpret within a broad clinical context. AI should therefore be integrated in a prudent and reasonable manner into the workflows of health professionals. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by BRI.

AB  - Analysis of the flexibility profile of basketball players (BPs) can reveal differences in range of motion (ROM) by gender and also identify those players who are at higher risk for sports injuries. A descriptive observational study was conducted to determine the lower extremity flexibility profile of sixty-four basketball players and gender differences to identify players at higher risk of injury due to limited and asymmetric ROM in one or more movements. Participants: Sixty-four (33 male and 31 female) competitive athletes from the national leagues of the Spanish basketball league system participated in the present study (power of sample size ≥0.99). The eight passive ROM tests of the hip, knee and ankle were assessed using the ROM-SPORT battery. Each player completed a questionnaire on age, basic anthropometric data, dominant extremities, and training and sport-related variables. The lower extremity flexibility profile was established at 15◦ and 10◦ hip extension (HE), 39◦ and 38◦ ankle dorsiflexion with knee extended (ADF-KE), 40◦ and 39◦ ankle dorsiflexion with knee flexed (ADF-KF), 43◦ and 43◦ hip abduction (HAB), 75◦ and 61◦ hip abduction with the hip flexed (HAB-HF), 78◦ and 83◦ hip flexion with the knee extended (HF-KE), 134◦ and 120◦ knee flexion (KF), and 145◦ and 144◦ hip flexion (HF) by male and female basketball players, respectively. Sex differences in HE, HAB-HF, and KF were observed in BPs (p ≤ 0.01; Hedges’ g ≥ 1.04). Players reported limited ROM in ADF-KF, HE, HAB-HF, HF-KE, and KF; and asymmetric ROM mainly in HE, ADF-KE, KF, ADF-KF, and HF-KE. In conclusion, this study provides gender-specific lower extremity flexibility profile scores in BPs that can help athletic trainers and athletic and conditioning trainers to identify those players who are at higher risk of injury due to abnormal ROM scores. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The emergence of pose estimation algorithms represents a potential paradigm shift in the study and assessment of human movement. Human pose estimation algorithms leverage advances in computer vision to track human movement automatically from simple videos recorded using common household devices with relatively low-cost cameras (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptop computers). In our view, these technologies offer clear and exciting potential to make measurement of human movement substantially more accessible; for example, a clinician could perform a quantitative motor assessment directly in a patient’s home, a researcher without access to expensive motion capture equipment could analyze movement kinematics using a smartphone video, and a coach could evaluate player performance with video recordings directly from the field. In this review, we combine expertise and perspectives from physical therapy, speech-language pathology, movement science, and engineering to provide insight into applications of pose estimation in human health and performance. We focus specifically on applications in areas of human development, performance optimization, injury prevention, and motor assessment of persons with neurologic damage or disease. We review relevant literature, share interdisciplinary viewpoints on future applications of these technologies to improve human health and performance, and discuss perceived limitations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Elite youth soccer players suffer increasing numbers of injuries owing to constantly increasing physical demands. Deficits in neuromuscular performance may increase the risk of injury. Injury risk factors need to be identified and practical cut-off scores defined. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess neuromuscular performance parameters within a laboratory-based injury risk screening, to investigate their association with the risk of non-contact lower extremity injuries in elite youth soccer players, and to provide practice-relevant cut-off scores. Methods: Sixty-two elite youth soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.1 years) performed unilateral postural control exercises in different conditions, isokinetic tests of concentric and eccentric knee extension and knee flexion (60°/s), isometric tests of hip adduction and abduction, and isometric tests of trunk flexion, extension, lateral flexion and transversal rotation during the preseason period. Non-contact lower extremities injuries were documented throughout 10 months. Risk profiling was assessed using a multivariate approach utilizing a Decision Tree model [Classification and Regression Tree (CART) method]. Results: Twenty-five non-contact injuries were registered. The Decision Tree model selected the COP sway, the peak torque for knee flexion concentric, the functional knee ratio and the path of the platform in that hierarchical order as important neuromuscular performance parameters to discriminate between injured and non-injured players. The classification showed a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.91. The relative risk was calculated at 4.2, meaning that the risk of suffering an injury is four times greater for a player, who has been classified as injured by the Decision Tree model. Conclusion: Measuring static postural control, postural control under unstable condition and the strength of the thigh seem to enable a good indication of injury risk in elite youth soccer players. However, this finding has to be taken with caution due to a small number of injury cases. Nonetheless, these preliminary results may have practical implications for future directions in injury risk screening and in planning and developing customized training programs to counteract intrinsic injury risk factors in elite youth soccer players.

AB  - Cluster analysis of knee abduction moment waveforms may be useful to examine biomechanical data. The aim of this study was to analyze if the knee abduction moment waveform of early peaks, consistent with anterior cruciate ligament injury mechanisms, was associated with foot-trunk distance, knee kinematics, and heel strike landing posture, all of which have been observed during anterior cruciate ligament injuries. One hundred and seventy-seven adolescent athletes performed cutting maneuvers, marker-based motion capture collected kinetic and marker data and an 8-segment musculoskeletal model was constructed. Knee abduction moment waveforms were clustered as either a large early peak, or not a large early peak using a two-step process with Euclidean distances and the Ward-d2 cluster method. Mediolateral distance between foot and trunk was associated with the large early peak waveform with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.4 (2.7–4.4). Knee flexion angle at initial contact and knee flexion excursion had odds ratios of 1.9 (1.6–2.4) and 1.6 (1.3–2.0). Knee abduction excursions had an odds ratio of 1.8 (1.1–2.4) and 1.8 (1.4–2.4), respectively. Heel strike landings and anteroposterior distance between foot and trunk were not associated with the large early peak waveform with odds ratios of 1.2 (0.9–1.7) and 1.1 (0.8–1.3), respectively. The knee abduction moment waveform is associated with several kinematic variables observed during ACL injury. The results support intervention programs that can modify these kinematics and thus reduce early stance phase knee abduction moments. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Joint mobility has been considered an important component of the physical fitness. Objective: This STROBE-based study aimed to evaluate the joint mobility in undergraduate students of Physical Education. Materials and methods: Data measurements were obtained for 239 students attending from 4th to 9th academic semester of a physical education major (200 men: 22±4.3 years, 1.72±0.05 m, 67±8.5 kg; and 39 women: 21±3.4 years, 1.61±0.07 m, 57±6.4 kg). Flexibility expressed as a General/global Index of Joint Mobility (GIJM) was measured through the Flexitest method, which assesses the maximum passive range of motion (ROM) of 20 body joint movements. We also reported the profile of ROM for the individual movements of the Flexitest battery. Results: The differences found between sexes, highlight index of general articular mobility (GIJM) and ROM (p&lt; .05). This aspect is also observed when comparing standardized joint limitations (p&lt; .01 ankle, knee, hip, trunk, elbow and shoulders). However, the homogeneity profile range of movement in the intermovement variability index, the interjoint variability index and the flexion-extension variability index indices don´t reflect gender differences (p&gt; .05), contrary to found in the between segment variability index and distal-proximal variability index (p&lt; .01). Conclusions: The hierarchical clustering algorithm subdivided the study participants into groups according to GIJM. We identified two significantly different phenotypes representing younger, lighter, and with higher joint mobility (Cluster 1) versus older, heavier, and with lower joint mobility students (Cluster 2). More research is needed to evaluate associations with body composition, physical performance, quality of life and academic success. © JPES.

AB  - Objective: To investigate (i) typical protocols used in research on biomechanical response to running-induced fatigue, (ii) the effect of sport-induced acute fatigue on the biomechanics of running and functional tests, and (iii) the consistency of analyzed parameter trends across different protocols. Methods: Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, and IEEE databases were searched using terms identified with the Population, Interest and Context (PiCo) framework. Studies were screened following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and appraised using the methodological index for non-randomized studies MINORS scale. Only experimental studies with at least 10 participants, which evaluated fatigue during and immediately after the fatiguing run were included. Each study was summarized to record information about the protocol and parameter trends. Summary trends were computed for each parameter based on the results found in individual studies. Results: Of the 68 included studies, most were based on in-lab (77.9%) protocols, endpoint measurements (75%), stationary measurement systems (76.5%), and treadmill environment (54.4%) for running. From the 42 parameters identified in response to acute fatigue, flight time, contact time, knee flexion angle at initial contact, trunk flexion angle, peak tibial acceleration, CoP velocity during balance test showed an increasing behavior and cadence, vertical stiffness, knee extension force during MVC, maximum vertical ground reaction forces, and CMJ height showed a decreasing trend across different fatigue protocols. Conclusion: This review presents evidence that running-induced acute fatigue influences almost all the included biomechanical parameters, with crucial influence from the exercise intensity and the testing environment. Results indicate an important gap in literature caused by the lack of field studies with continuous measurement during outdoor running activities. To address this gap, we propose recommendations for the use of wearable inertial sensors. © Copyright © 2021 Apte, Prigent, Stöggl, Martínez, Snyder, Gremeaux-Bader and Aminian.

AB  - | INTRODUCTION: Basketball is a physical contact sport that involves complex movements such as jumping, spinning, and changing directions, all of which frequently cause injuries. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to understand the characteristics of injuries on adolescent basketball athletes. METHODS: This study uses a descriptive method with a cross-sectional study approach using a web-based questionnaire (Google Forms) consisting of close-ended questions to examine the history, types, factors, and treatments of the injuries experienced by the adolescent basketball athletes at the Student Sports Training Center (Pusat Pelatihan Olahraga Pelajar or PPOP) of DKI Jakarta. The subjects are 14 male and female athletes with an average age of 15.9±1.1 years old, an average height of 172.29±9.33 centimeters, and an average weight of 65.71±10.06 kilogram. The research instrument is a questionnaire distributed online in the form of Google Forms. A validity test was conducted on the questionnaire using Aikens. Data Questionnaire result data were analyzed using a percentage analysis on the answers to each question in the questionnaire. RESULTS: The results revealed that 76% of the athletes experienced injuries in the lower limb, with the most frequent injury in the ankle joint (45%). Furthermore, the athletes also stated that sprains/twists are the most experienced type of injury (42%). The training sessions were when 79% of the athletes experienced their injuries, whereas the other 21% experienced them during the matches. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study cannot generalize the findings because it only involved 14 participants, which is also a limitation of this study, but these findings report that the greater injury that occurs during exercise is the ankle joint, so the authors suggest doing an adequate warm-up. Before starting a training session or during a competitive training session, preventing injuries is the best approach for athletes to reduce their occurrence. © 2021, BAHIANA - School of Medicine and Public Health.

AB  - The possibility of measuring predictive factors to discriminate athletes at higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury still represents an open research question. We performed an observational study with thirteen female basketball players who performed monopodalic jumps and single-leg squat tests. One of them suffered from an ACL injury after the first test session. Data gathered from twelve participants, who did not suffer from ACL injury, were used for a reliability analysis. Parameters related to leg stability, load absorption capability and leg mobility showed good-to-excellent reliability. Path length, root mean square of the acceleration and leg angle with respect to the vertical axis revealed themselves as possible predictive factors to identify athletes at higher risk. Results confirm that six months after reconstruction represents the correct time for these athletes to return to playing. Furthermore, the training of leg mobility and load absorption capability could allow athletes to reduce the probability of new injuries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: Infrared thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive, contactless and low-cost technology that allows recording of the radiating energy that is released from a body, providing an estimate of its superficial temperature. Thanks to the improvement of infrared thermal detectors, this technique is widely used in the biomedical field to monitor the skin temperature for different purposes (e.g. assessing circulatory diseases, psychophysiological state, affective computing). Particularly, in sports and exercise science, thermography is extensively used to assess sports performance, to investigate superficial vascular changes induced by physical exercise, and to monitor injuries. However, the methods of analysis employed to treat IRT data are not standardized, and hence introduce variability in the results. Approach: This review focuses on the methods of analysis currently used for thermal imaging in sports and exercise science. Main Results: Firstly, the procedures employed for the selection of regions of interest (ROIs) from anatomical body districts are reviewed, paying attention also to the potentialities of morphing algorithms to increase the reproducibility of thermal results. Secondly, the statistical approaches utilized to characterize the temperature frequency and spatial distributions within ROIs are investigated, showing their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the importance of employing tracking methods to analyze the temporal thermal oscillations within ROIs is discussed. Thirdly, the capability of employing procedures of investigation based on machine learning frameworks on thermal imaging in sports science is examined. Significance: Finally, some proposals to improve the standardization and the reproducibility of IRT data analysis are provided, in order to facilitate the development of a common database of thermal images and to improve the effectiveness of IRT in sports science. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine

AB  - Shock impacts during activity may cause damage to the joints, muscles, bones, or inner organs. To define thresholds for tolerable impacts, there is a need for methods that can accurately monitor shock impacts in real‐life settings. Therefore, the main aim of this scoping review was to present an overview of existing methods for assessments of shock impacts using wearable sensor technology within two domains: sports and occupational settings. Online databases were used to identify papers published in 2010–2020, from which we selected 34 papers that used wearable sensor technology to measure shock impacts. No studies were found on occupational settings. For the sports domain, accelerometry was the dominant type of wearable sensor technology utilized, interpreting peak acceleration as a proxy for impact. Of the included studies, 28 assessed foot strike in running, head impacts in invasion and team sports, or different forms of jump landings or plyometric movements. The included studies revealed a lack of consensus regarding sensor placement and interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the identified high proportion of validation studies support previous concerns that wearable sensors at present are inadequate as a stand‐alone method for valid and accurate data on shock impacts in the field. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: To conduct a review of active United States–based clinical trials investigating preventative, symptom resolution, and disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: We conducted a review of currently active clinical trials for OA using data obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov database as of August 2020. The inclusion criteria were active studies registered in the United States that involved the prevention, symptom resolution, or disease modification of OA. Descriptive statistics were recorded and summarized. Results: A total of 3,859 clinical trials were identified, and 310 were included in the final analysis. Of the currently active trials, 89% (n = 275) targeted symptom resolution in patients with existing OA, 6% (n = 19) targeted OA disease-modifying therapeutics, and 5% (n = 16) targeted the prevention of OA in high-risk patients (P < .001). Primary interventions included medical devices (44%, n = 137), pharmaceutical drugs (14%, n = 42), surgical procedures (14%, n = 42), cellular biologics (13%, n = 41), and behavioral therapies (13%, n = 41). There was a significantly higher number of disease-modifying therapeutics for cellular biologics than pharmaceutical drugs (30% vs 14%) (P = .015). Most trials targeted the knee joint (63%, P = .042), with 38% of all trials evaluating joint arthroplasty. There were no significant differences between private sector and government funding sources (43% and 49%, respectively) (P = .288), yet there was a significantly lower rate of funding from industry (8%) (P = .026). Conclusions: There was a significantly higher number of clinical trials investigating symptomatic resolution therapy (89%) for existing OA in comparison to preventative (5%) and disease-modifying (6%) therapies. The most common interventions involved medical devices and joint replacement surgery, with the knee joint accounting for more than 60% of the current clinical trials for OA. There was a significantly higher number of disease-modifying therapeutics for cellular biologics than pharmaceutical drugs. Funding of clinical trials was split between the private sector and government, with a low rate of reported funding from industry partners. Clinical Relevance: Identifying existing needs in the current market may help increase rates of research funding or optimize current funding pathways, in this study, specifically for targeting unaddressed focus areas in OA research. Our systematic review highlights the potential need for additional research and development regarding OA preventative and disease-modifying therapies. © 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America

Most trials involved multicenter research designs (61%, n = 188), whereas the remaining trials were performed at a single research center (39%, n = 122). Of the trials reporting clinical trial phases (n = 93), 2% were in early phase I, 18% were in phase I, 41% were in phase II, 22% were in phase III, and 17% were in phase IV. Seventy percent of the clinical trials (n = 217) were reported as “phase not applicable.” Regarding reporting of funding, 43% of clinical trials (n = 133) were privately funded (individuals, universities, and/or organizations), 42% (n = 130) were funded by other U.S. federal agencies, 8% (n = 24) were funded by industry sponsors, and 7% (n = 23) were funded by the NIH directly. No significant difference was found between the incidence of government funding sources and the incidence of private funding sources (P = .288); however, the incidence of industry funding was significantly lower in comparison to government and private funding (χ 2 [2, n = 24] = 4.2, P = .026).

AB  - The sports industry utilizes science to improve short to long-term team and player management regarding budget, health, tactics, training, and most importantly performance. Data Science (DS) and Sports Analytics play key roles in supporting teams, players and experts to improve performance. This paper reviews the literature to identify important attributes correlated with injuries and attempts to quantify their impact on player and team performance, using analytics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 2010 up to 2020. It also provides an overview of Machine Learning (ML) and DS techniques and algorithms used to study injuries. Additionally, it provides information for coaches, sports and health scientists, managers and decision makers to recognize the most common injuries and investigate possible injury patterns during competitions. We identify teams and players who suffered the most, and the type of injuries requiring more attention. We found a high impact from injuries and pathologies on performance; musculoskeletal impairments are the most common ones that lead to decreased performance. Finally, we conclude that there is a weak positive relationship between performance and injuries based on a holistic multivariate model that describes player and team performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purposes of this study were to describe the lower extremities joints range of motion (ROM) profile using a comprehensive approach in futsal players and to examine potential player position (goalkeepers vs. outfield players), competitive level (first [top] division vs. second division), number of playing years, sex (males vs. females), and bilateral (dominant limb vs. non-dominant limb) differences. A total of 72 male and 67 female elite futsal players from 11 clubs were measured of passive hip (flexion with knee flexed [HFKF] and extended [HFKE], extension [HE], abduction [HA], external [HER], and internal [HIR] rotation), knee (flexion [KF]) and ankle (dorsiflexion with knee flexed [ADFKF] and extended [ADFKE]) ROMs. Bayesian inferences exploring differences between player position, competitive level, sex and limb were made. A Bayesian correlation analysis was conducted to explore the influence of playing years on joints ROMs. The results showed no significant player position or competitive level related differences in any average ROM score. However, statistically significant sex-related differences were documented whereby female players reported higher hip and knee joints ROM average values than their male counterparts. Especially relevant were the proportions of males (72%) and players from teams engaged in the second division (61%) displaying limited HFKE ROMs. Likewise, around 35% of all players showed restricted ADFKF ROMs. In addition, approximately 21, 18, 22, and 25% of the futsal players were identified as having bilateral asymmetries (≥8°) for HA, HIR, HER, and KF ROMs, respectively. Finally, Bayesian correlation analysis did not report any significant association between years of playing futsal and ROM measures (all r values &lt; 0.34). The implications that these restricted HFKE and ADFKF ROMs and bilateral asymmetries in hip (abduction, internal and external rotation) and knee (flexion) ROMs caused by the practice of futsal may have on physical performance and injury risk warrant future research. © Copyright © 2021 Cejudo, Ruiz-Pérez, Hernández-Sánchez, De Ste Croix, Sainz de Baranda and Ayala.

AB  - (1) Dynamic knee valgus is a predisposing factor for anterior cruciate ligament rupture and osteoarthritis. The single-leg squat (SLS) test is a widely used movement pattern test in clinical practice that helps to assess the risk of lower-limb injury. We aimed to quantify the SLS test using a marker-less optical system. (2) Kinect validity and accuracy during SLS were established by marker-based OptiTrack and MVN Xsens motion capture systems. Then, 22 individuals with moderate knee symptoms during sports activities (Tegner > 4, Lysholm > 60) performed SLS, and this was recorded and analyzed with a Kinect Azure camera and the Dynaknee software. (3) An optical sensor coupled to an artificial-intelligence-based joint recognition algorithm gave a comparable result to traditional marker-based motion capture devices. The dynamic valgus sign quantified by the Q-angle at the lowest point of the squat is highly dependent on squat depth, which severely limits its comparability among subjects. In contrast, the medio-lateral shift of the knee midpoint at a fixed squat depth, expressed in the percentage of lower limb length, is more suitable to quantify dynamic valgus and compare values among individual patients. (4) The current study identified a new and reliable way of evaluating dynamic valgus of the knee joint by measuring the medial shift of the knee-over-foot at a standardized squat depth. Using a marker-less optical system widens the possibilities of evaluating lower limb functional instabilities for medical professionals. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury represents one of the main disorders affecting players, especially in contact sports. Even though several approaches based on artificial intelligence have been developed to allow the quantification of ACL injury risk, their applicability in training sessions compared with the clinical scale is still an open question. We proposed a machine-learning approach to accomplish this purpose. Thirty-nine female basketball players were enrolled in the study. Leg stability, leg mobility and capability to absorb the load after jump were evaluated through inertial sensors and optoelectronic bars. The risk level of athletes was computed by the Landing Error Score System (LESS). A comparative analysis among nine classifiers was performed by assessing the accuracy, F1-score and goodness. Five out nine examined classifiers reached optimum performance, with the linear support vector machine achieving an accuracy and F1-score of 96 and 95%, respectively. The feature importance was computed, allowing us to promote the ellipse area, parameters related to the load absorption and the leg mobility as the most useful features for the prediction of anterior cruciate ligament injury risk. In addition, the ellipse area showed a strong correlation with the LESS score. The results open the possibility to use such a methodology for predicting ACL injury. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to quantify joint kinematics through a wearable sensor system in multidirectional high‐speed complex movements used in a protocol for rehabilitation and return to sport assessment after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury, and to validate it against a gold standard optoelectronic marker‐based system. Thirty‐four healthy athletes were evaluated through a full‐body wearable sensor (MTw Awinda, Xsens) and a marker‐based optoelectronic (Vicon Nexus, Vicon) system during the execution of three tasks: drop jump, forward sprint, and 90° change of direction. Clinically relevant joint angles of lower limbs and trunk were compared through Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), and the Coefficient of Multiple Correlation (CMC). An excellent agreement (r > 0.94, CMC > 0.96) was found for knee and hip sagittal plane kinematics in all the movements. A fair‐to‐excellent agreement was found for frontal (r 0.55–0.96, CMC 0.63–0.96) and transverse (r 0.45–0.84, CMC 0.59–0.90) plane kinematics. Movement complexity slightly affected the agreement between the systems. The system based on wearable sensors showed fair-to‐excellent concurrent validity in the evaluation of the specific joint parameters commonly used in rehabilitation and return to sport assessment after ACL injury for complex movements. The ACL professionals could benefit from full‐body wearable technology in the on‐field rehabilitation of athletes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recently wearables have become a game changer in sports activities. Wearable devices influence the game in tracking and monitoring the performance of the player on field in real time. This paper aims to explore the uses and applications of wearables in the area of sports. These devices help to bridge the gap between technology and user. Also it gives a comprehensive analysis of the player to improve his skills and get real time feedback which would benefit himself and his trainer. This paper surveys the important research work done in the area of wearables under four categories: (i) performance monitoring (ii) sports injury (iii) biometric parameters and (iv) energy efficiency. These various considerations provide many opportunities for advancement in wearable technology with a goal of enabling non-invasive measurement of physiological and activity parameters of a player. Wearable technology is still in development phase and the paper concludes with the research opportunities and the challenges faced. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The epidemiology of injuries in female soccer has been studied extensively in several national leagues. Even so, data on the first division Spanish league are limited. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of the first division of the Spanish Women’s Soccer League and to analyze data in relation to game position, circumstance, or the moment of injury. Fifteen teams and 123 players participated in the study. Players’ characteristics and their injuries (location, type, diagnosis, circumstance, and moment) were collected. Injuries were described by their fre-quencies (number and percentage) and incidence rates (IR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Lower limb injuries accounted for 86.8% of total injuries. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and me-niscus injuries occurred in totality in non-contact circumstance (0.35/1000 h; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.62 and 0.23/1000 h; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.45, respectively). Match injury IRs (19.02/1000 h; 95% CI, 14.89 to 23.97) were significantly higher than training (1.70/1000 h; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.22). As a conclusion, structures such as the ACL or meniscus are most commonly injured in the non-contact circumstance in the first division of the Spanish Women’s Soccer League. In addition, match situations involve a greater risk of injury than training, increasing the risk to the ankle and knee injuries as the season pro-gresses. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Sport ist ein wichtiger Teil unserer Gesellschaft und hat weitreichende positive Wirkungen auf unsere Gesundheit. Leider geht ein Teil dieser positiven Wirkungen durch Sportverletzungen verloren. Inzwischen ist die Evidenz von Präventionsprogrammen zur Vermeidung von Sportverletzungen an Knie, Hüfte, OSG und Schulter gut belegt. Am Kniegelenk ist die Datenlage am größten, hier können bei Adoleszenten und jungen Frauen bis zu 67% der vorderen Kreuzbandverletzungen vermieden werden. Am schlechtesten untersucht ist die Schulter, hier gibt es nur wenige randomisierte Studien, die jedoch auch eine signifikante Verletzungsreduktion zeigen konnten. Somit ist vor allem eine Implementierung der Präventionsprogramme in das tägliche Training der Sportler zu fordern, gleichzeitig aber die Erfassung von Sportverletzungen und Ausbildung aller Akteure zu verbessern. Zukünftig werden neue Technologien (Sensoren, künstliche Intelligenz) eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Sport is an important part of our society and has far-reaching positive effects on our health. Unfortunately, some of these positive effects are lost again due to sports injuries. In the meantime, the evidence of prevention programs to avoid sports injuries in knee, hip, ankle and shoulder is well documented. The data is greatest for the knee joint, where up to 67% of anterior cruciate ligament injuries can be avoided in adolescents and young female adults. The shoulder is still the least studied area, where there are only a few randomized studies, but which could also show a significant reduction in injuries. Thus, the main challenge is to implement prevention programs in the daily training of athletes, while at the same time improving the registration of sports injuries and the training of all players. In the future, new technologies (sensors, artificial intelligence) will certainly play an important role. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Lower extremity non-contact soft tissue (LE-ST) injuries are prevalent in elite futsal. The purpose of this study was to develop robust screening models based on pre-season measures obtained from questionnaires and field-based tests to prospectively predict LE-ST injuries after having applied a range of supervised Machine Learning techniques. One hundred and thirty-nine elite futsal players underwent a pre-season screening evaluation that included individual characteristics; measures related to sleep quality, athlete burnout, psychological characteristics related to sport performance and self-reported perception of chronic ankle instability. A number of neuromuscular performance measures obtained through three field-based tests [isometric hip strength, dynamic postural control (Y-Balance) and lower extremity joints range of motion (ROM-Sport battery)] were also recorded. Injury incidence was monitored over one competitive season. There were 25 LE-ST injuries. Only those groups of measures from two of the field-based tests (ROM-Sport battery and Y-Balance), as independent data sets, were able to build robust models [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score ≥0.7] to identify elite futsal players at risk of sustaining a LE-ST injury. Unlike the measures obtained from the five questionnaires selected, the neuromuscular performance measures did build robust prediction models (AUC score ≥0.7). The inclusion in the same data set of the measures recorded from all the questionnaires and field-based tests did not result in models with significantly higher performance scores. The model generated by the UnderBagging technique with a cost-sensitive SMO as the base classifier and using only four ROM measures reported the best prediction performance scores (AUC = 0.767, true positive rate = 65.9% and true negative rate = 62%). The models developed might help coaches, physical trainers and medical practitioners in the decision-making process for injury prevention in futsal. © Copyright © 2021 Ruiz-Pérez, López-Valenciano, Hernández-Sánchez, Puerta-Callejón, De Ste Croix, Sainz de Baranda and Ayala.

AB  - Basketball is a team sport in which the players undergo rapid reactions, and running efforts are usually carried out in all directions. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the muscle activity response in different basketball movements, considering two types of athletes with different levels of experience. Using a group of nine volunteers, female athletes from a senior basketball team, a data acquisition protocol was defined to identify the changes that occurred throughout the sports season. In this study, to assess the gastrocnemius muscle activity, intensity peak (%MC) and time to peak (TP) were evaluated for five typical basketball skills and movements involving running and jumping with and without the ball. Seven repetitions were executed for each movement, performed at two different time-points of the sports season: at the beginning of the teams’ competition, in November (T1), and at the season peak, in March (T2). TP presents greater values for T2 of the season when compared with T1. The results show that the level of experience of the athletes has a significant effect on the results of TP and %MC, particularly when comparing the two seasons. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to present how predictive machine learning methods can be utilized for detecting sport injury risk factors in a data-driven manner. The approach can be used for finding new hypotheses for risk factors and confirming the predictive power of previously recognized ones. We used three-dimensional motion analysis and physical data from 314 young basketball and floorball players (48.4% males, 15.72±1.79 yr, 173.34±9.14 cm, 64.65±10.4 kg). Both linear (L1-regularized logistic regression) and non-linear methods (random forest) were used to predict moderate and severe knee and ankle injuries (N=57) during three-year follow-up. Results were confirmed with permutation tests and predictive risk factors detected with Wilcoxon signed-rank-test (p<0.01). Random forest suggested twelve consistent injury predictors and logistic regression twenty. Ten of these were suggested in both models; sex, body mass index, hamstring flexibility, knee joint laxity, medial knee displacement, height, ankle plantar flexion at initial contact, leg press one-repetition max, and knee valgus at initial contact. Cross-validated areas under receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.65 (logistic regression) and 0.63 (random forest). The results highlight the difficulty of predicting future injuries, but also show that even with models having relatively low predictive power, certain predictive injury risk factors can be consistently detected. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

AB  - Background: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological data of injuries in male and female youth football players. Methods: Searches were performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases. Studies were considered if they reported injury incidence rate in male and female youth (≤19 years old) football players. Two reviewers (FJRP and ALV) extracted data and assessed trial quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach determined the quality of evidence. Studies were combined using a Poisson random effects regression model. Results: Forty-three studies were included. The overall incidence rate was 5.70 injuries/1000 h in males and 6.77 injuries/1000 h in females. Match injury incidence (14.43 injuries/1000 h in males and 14.97 injuries/1000 h in females) was significantly higher than training injury incidence (2.77 injuries/1000 h in males and 2.62 injuries/1000 h in females). The lower extremity had the highest incidence rate in both sexes. The most common type of injury was muscle/tendon for males and joint/ligament for females. Minimal injuries were the most common in both sexes. The incidence rate of injuries increased with advances in chronological age in males. Elite male players presented higher match injury incidence than sub-elite players. In females, there was a paucity of data for comparison across age groups and levels of play. Conclusion: The high injury incidence rates and sex differences identified for the most common location and type of injury reinforce the need for implementing different targeted injury-risk mitigation strategies in male and female youth football players. © 2021

AB  - Background: Sex-based biomechanical differences during a drop vertical jump (DVJ) may explain the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in females. Video motion capture using artificial intelligence (VMocap) is a new method for accurate motion analysis. Purpose: To use VMocap to identify sex-based differences in biomechanics during a DVJ in Asian athletes. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 63 female and 61 male Asian soccer players volunteered for this study in 2018. Participants performed a bilateral DVJ using VMocap, and the knee valgus angle (KVA), knee flexion angle (KFA), hip flexion angle (HFA), and lower leg anterior inclination angle (LAIA) were calculated from the motion capture data. These joint angles and inclination angles were evaluated at the time of highest point of the first jump (H1), initial contact (IC), maximum knee flexion (MKF), toe-off (TO), and highest point of the second jump (H2). The unpaired t test was used to compare sex-based differences. Results: At H1, the KVA in females showed more valgus (−2.9° vs −5.4°) and the LAIA in females was greater (29.1° vs 25.7°) versus males (P <.01 for both). At IC, the KVA in females showed more valgus (−1.3° vs −3.0°) and females had a greater KFA (20.8° vs 14.3°) and LAIA (5.1° vs 0.0°) compared with males (P <.01 for all). At MKF, female KVA showed more valgus (6.2° vs −9.5°), and females had greater LAIA (36.6° vs 34.6°), smaller KFA (77.5° vs 87.5°), and smaller HFA (55.8° vs 82.0°) compared with males (P <.01 for all). At TO, female KVA showed more valgus (−0.7° vs −3.1°) and female KFA, HFA, and LAIA were greater (31.7° vs 19.2°; 19.9° vs 16.4°; and 18.2° vs 11.5°, respectively) than males (P <.01 for all). At H2, females had a greater KFA (18.6° vs 14.6°) and LAIA (13.3° vs 9.9°) than males (P <.04 for both). Conclusion: Asian female soccer players showed increased KVA and LAIA, decreased KFA and HFA at MKF, and increased KFA at IC and TO compared with their male counterparts in this analysis of the DVJ. Clinical Relevance: Elucidation of kinematic differences between the sexes can aid in predicting injuries. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The large number of sports injuries, especially in football, is becoming a major problem for professionals who work with athletes, making it one of the team sports with the highest injury incidence rates. The objective of this review is to offer an overview of the most recent scientific publications in relation to injuries in high-performance football. For this, a systematic review was carried out from 2015 to 2020, searching with the terms of the UNESCO Thesaurus: "injuries", "football", "elite", "professional football" and "high performance" in the international databases Scopus and Web of Science and the Spanish database Dialnet, allowing the selection of original articles (experimental, descriptive, quasi- experimental studies and/or case studies), which included information on this line of research. A total of 833 articles were found, although this was reduced to 67 articles after applying the review's inclusion criteria. These publications were divided into three main categories: A) Research related to characteristics and types of injuries, B) Research related to game conditions and training loads and C) Other topics studied. In conclusion, this systematic review allows us to quickly and easily analyse information about injuries in high-performance football in recent years. These results are interesting for the researchers and different professionals who comprise coaching staff in football clubs. © 2021 Montenegrin Sports Academy. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the use of biomechanics in identifying the mechanistic causes of musculoskeletal tissue injury and degeneration. It appraises how biomechanics has been used to develop training programmes aiming to maintain or recover tissue health. Tissue health depends on the functional mechanical environment experienced by tissues during daily and rehabilitation activities. These environments are the result of the interactions between tissue motion, loading, biology, and morphology. Maintaining health of and/or repairing musculoskeletal tissues requires targeting the “ideal” in vivo tissue mechanics (i.e., loading and deformation), which may be enabled by appropriate real-time biofeedback. Recent research shows that biofeedback technologies may increase their quality and effectiveness by integrating a personalised neuromusculoskeletal modelling driven by real-time motion capture and medical imaging. Model personalisation is crucial in obtaining physically and physiologically valid predictions of tissue biomechanics. Model real-time execution is crucial and achieved by code optimisation and artificial intelligence methods. Furthermore, recent work has also shown that laboratory-based motion capture biomechanical measurements and modelling can be performed outside the laboratory with wearable sensors and artificial intelligence. The next stage is to combine these technologies into well-designed easy to use products to guide training to maintain or recover tissue health in the real-world. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Methods: The present study is quasi experimental and the research design is of two groups with pre-test and post-test processes in both groups and interventions on the experimental group. For this research, 80 Imam Ali military university students were selected purposefully based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then subjects were randomly divided into two groups included 40 subjects in the experimental and 40 subjects in the control group. Functional movement screen (FMS) test was used to evaluate the performance of the subject and the Nordic questionnaire was used to assess the musculoskeletal pain. Then the subject in the experimental group performed an injury prevention program for 8 weeks and 3 sessions per week (24 sessions). And during this period, subject in the control group performed their daily programs. At the end of the exercise, the post-test similar to the pre-test was taken from both groups. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical method was used to check the normality of the data and paired t-test and analysis of covariance were used to evaluate the performance test scores and musculoskeletal pain of the two groups before and after the intervention. Results: The results of paired t-test showed that in all tests of FMS except shoulder flexibility, a significant difference was found between pre-test and post-test only in the experimental group (P <0.05). Also, the results of analysis of covariance showed an improvement in the performance of the subjects in all tests except shoulder flexibility, in the posttest between the two groups (P <0.05). Also, the results of Nordic questionnaire showed that the disorders in the lumbar region are 65 present and in the knee region are 53 present. The number of people with mild lumbar injury decreased in the experimental group from 18 to 9 injuries and the number of people with severe lumbar injuries decreased from 6 to 2 injuries which showed a significant difference before and after eight weeks of intervention (P <0.05) but this difference was not significant in the control group (P >0/05). Also, the number of people with mild knee injuries in the experimental group decreased from 12 to 4 injuries and the number of people with severe knee injuries decreased from 7 to 2 injuries witch showed a significant decrease before and after eight weeks of intervention (P <0/05) but this difference was not significant in the control group (P >0/05). Conclusion: The present study showed that the injury prevention program has an effect on performance and musculoskeletal pain in knee and lower back of students of Imam Ali Military University and instructors and professors of military universities can use this injury prevention program to reduce pain and improve performance. © 2021 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the effects of a strength training injury-prevention program (STIPP) on injuries associated with weakness of the gluteal muscles in professional handball players. Twenty-seven professional Spanish male handball players from the same club, who competed at the Spanish Second National League level, participated in this study. The investigation was conducted over 2 consecutive seasons (2017–2018 and 2018–2019). The first season served as the control season (n = 21), and the second season served as the experimental season (n = 20). The STIPP was conducted 2 times per week, for 32 weeks, during the in-season period. There were no significant improvements in the injury incidence, pattern, or type for the experimental season group compared with the control season group (injury rate ratio [IRR] = 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84–2.58; p = 0.17). However, there was a meaningful reduction in the number and burden of lumbar injuries after the STIPP (IRR = 55.83; 95% CI: 0.11–89.01; p = 0.001). In addition, burden values (number of absence days/1000 hours exposure) in all injury pathologies were lower during the experimental season compared with the control season. The STIPP focused on the gluteal muscles could be effective in reducing the number and burden of lumbar injuries in professional handball players. © 2021 National Strength and Conditioning Association

AB  - Alternative shoe fit configurations can improve agility performance, however the joint level biomechanical changes that contribute to enhanced performance are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in joint-level biomechanics related to jumping and cutting performance and potential injury risk mechanisms, between different shoe upper configurations. NCAA Division 1 and club-level male athletes (n = 31) recruited from lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and rugby performed four agility-based movements: Lateral Skater Jump Repeats (LSJ), Countermovement Jump Repeats (CMJ), Triangle Drop Step Drill (TDS), and Anterior-Posterior Drill (AP). Each athlete performed the movements in four shoe upper closures: Standard Closure, Lace Replacement, Y Wrap, and Tri Panel. Ankle, knee and hip range of motion and peak joint moments in the sagittal, frontal and transverse planes, as well as peak joint powers, were calculated for CMJ and LSJ movements. Alternative fit configurations led to increased ankle plantarflexion and knee extension joint moments. Further, frontal and transverse plane ranges of motion at the ankle, knee and hip were reduced with at least one alternative fit configuration. These findings help to explain improved agility performance with upper configurations designed to better fit the shape of the foot and suggest improved lower limb alignment which may help to prevent musculoskeletal injury. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of catastrophic non-contact knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom early-warning detection system. This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F_z 0.97, anterior F_y 0.96 (both running), and lateral F_x 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). Conclusion: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing. The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study. Significance: Coaching, medical, and allied health staff could ultimately use this technology to monitor a range of joint loading indicators during game play, with the aim to minimize the occurrence of non-contact injuries in elite and community-level sports. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Each year, 50% of runners suffer from injuries. Consequently, more studies are being published about running biomechanics; these studies identify factors that can help prevent injuries. Scientific evidence suggests that recreational runners should use personalized biomechanical training plans, not only to improve their performance, but also to prevent injuries caused by the inability of amateur athletes to tolerate increased loads, and/or because of poor form. This study provides an overview of the different normative patterns of lower limb muscle activation and articular ranges of the pelvis during running, at self-selected speeds, in men and women. Methods: 38 healthy runners aged 18 to 49 years were included in this work. We examined eight muscles by applying two wearable superficial electromyography sensors and an inertial sensor for three-dimensional (3D) pelvis kinematics. Results: the largest differences were obtained for gluteus maximus activation in the first double float phase (p = 0.013) and second stance phase (p = 0.003), as well as in the gluteus medius in the second stance phase (p = 0.028). In both cases, the activation distribution was more homogeneous in men and presented significantly lower values than those obtained for women. In addition, there was a significantly higher percentage of total vastus medialis activation in women throughout the running cycle with the median (25th–75th percentile) for women being 12.50% (9.25–14) and 10% (9–12) for men. Women also had a greater range of pelvis rotation during running at self-selected speeds (p = 0.011). Conclusions: understanding the differences between men and women, in terms of muscle activation and pelvic kinematic values, could be especially useful to allow health professionals detect athletes who may be at risk of injury. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction Hamstring muscle injuries (HMI) continue to plague professional football. Several scientific publications have encouraged a multifactorial approach; however, no multifactorial HMI risk reduction studies have been conducted in professional football. Furthermore, individualisation of HMI management programmes has only been researched in a rehabilitation setting. Therefore, this study aims to determine if a specific multifactorial and individualised programme can reduce HMI occurrence in professional football. Methods and analysis We conducted a prospective cohort study over two seasons within the Finnish Premier League and compare the amount of HMI sustained during a control season to an intervention season. Injury data and sport exposure were collected during the two seasons (2019-2020), and a multifactorial and individualised HMI risk reduction programme was be implemented during intervention season (2020). After a hamstring screening protocol is completed, individual training was be defined for each player within several categories: lumbo-pelvic control, range of motion, posterior chain strength, sprint mechanical output and an additional non-individualised â € training for all players' category. Screening and respective updates to training programmes were conducted three times during the season. The outcome was to compare whether there was a significant effect of the intervention on the HMI occurrence using Cox regression analysis. Ethics and dissemination Approval for the injury and sport exposure data collection was obtained by the Saint-Etienne University Hospital Ethics Committee (request number: IORG0007394; record number IRBN322016/CHUSTE). Approval for the intervention season was obtained from the Central Finland healthcare District (request and record number: U6/2019). ©

AB  - Mental imagery (MI) research has mainly focused to date on mechanisms of effect and performance gains associated with muscle and neural tissues. MI's potential to affect fascia has rarely been considered. This paper conceptualizes ways in which MI might mutually interact with fascial tissue to support performance and cognitive functions. Such ways acknowledge, among others, MI's positive effect on proprioception, body schema, and pain. Drawing on cellular, physiological, and functional similarities and associations between muscle and fascial tissues, we propose that MI has the potential to affect and be affected by fascial tissue. We suggest that fascia-targeted MI (fascial mental imagery; FMI) can therefore be a useful approach for scientific as well as clinical purposes. We use the example of fascial dynamic neuro-cognitive imagery (FDNI) as a codified FMI method available for scientific and therapeutic explorations into rehabilitation and prevention of fascia-related disabling conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The benefits of differentiating between the physiological and biomechanical load-response pathways in football and other (team) sports have become increasingly recognised. In contrast to physiological loads however, the biomechanical demands of training and competition are still not well understood, primarily due to the difficulty of quantifying biomechanical loads in a field environment. Although musculoskeletal adaptation and injury are known to occur at a tissue level, several biomechanical load metrics are available that quantify loads experienced by the body as a whole, its different structures and the individual tissues that are part of these structures. This paper discusses the distinct aspects and challenges that are associated with measuring biomechanical loads at these different levels in laboratory and/or field contexts. Our hope is that through this paper, sport scientists and practitioners will be able to critically consider the value and limitations of biomechanical load metrics and will keep pursuing new methods to measure these loads within and outside the lab, as a detailed load quantification is essential to better understand the biomechanical load-response pathways that occur in the field. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Basketball is a contact sport game that includes important stresses of the lower limb joints. It follows an increased risk of developing acute traumatic pathologies, among which the lesion of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee (ACL). The study aims at investigating the presence of ACL injury risk factors detectable with a wearable inertial system in a national competitive basketball player subjected to prospective collegial surveys, as well as indices for monitoring the return to play of the athlete. The injured participant suffered the ACL rupture during an international basketball match, which took place a month after the first evaluation session. The athlete underwent ACL reconstruction followed by a 6-months rehabilitation period. The evaluation of jump landing task was performed before and after the knee injury with the OPTOGait and GYKO sensors. The results showed significant differences in parameters of the injured lower limb compared to the contralateral limb in the pre-surgery evaluation. In addition, several leg stability parameters, such as ellipse area and path length in all directions, can be considered as useful indices to decide the return to competition of the athlete. The outcomes open the possibility to perform sport-specific quantitative analysis to obtain indices useful to assess the risk of ACL injury and to monitor the progress during the rehabilitation program. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Injury prevention programs for athletes are still limited by a lack of understanding of specific risk factors that can influence injuries within different sports. The majority of studies on volleyball have not considered the movement patterns when moving in different directions or in planned and unplanned block jump-landings. Methods: This study investigated all planes mechanics between the lead and trail limb when moving in dominant and non-dominant directions, for both planned and unplanned jump-landings in thirteen semi-professional female volleyball players. Ankle, knee and hip joint kinematics, kinetics and joint stiffness were recorded. Results: Our results showed statistically significant differences between the lead limb and the trail limb in the hip flexion angles, moments and velocity; in the knee flexion angles, moments, stiffness, power and energy absorption and in the ankle dorsiflexion, power and energy absorption, showing a tendency where the lead limb has a higher injury risk than the trail limb. When considering planned versus unplanned situations, there were statistically significant differences in knee flexion angles, moments, power and energy absorption; and hip contact angle, flexion angular velocity and energy absorption, with musculoskeletal adaptations in the planned situations. Discussion: It appears that the role of the limb, either lead or trail, is more important than the limb dominance when performing directional jump-landings, with the lead limb having a higher implication on possible overuse injuries than the trail limb. Furthermore, planned movements showed a difference in strategy indicating greater implications to possible overuse injuries than in the unplanned situations which may be associated with more conscious thought about the movements. Conclusion: Coaches should consider unilateral coordination training in both landing directions for the lead and trail limb, and should adapt training to replicate the competition environment, using unplanned situations to minimize asymmetries to might reduce injury risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To report the consistency in movement strategy selection in athletic groin pain patients and to assess whether there are differences in consistency between athletic groin pain patients and healthy athletes. Design: Cross sectional exploratory study. Methods: Twenty athletic groin pain patients and 21 healthy athletes performed 15 repetitions of 110° change of direction task. Lower limb and trunk kinematics alongside ground reaction forces were collected. A correlation-to-mean algorithm was used to allocate each trial to a movement strategy using kinematic and kinetic features. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare the frequency of the most selected strategy (i.e. consistency) and fuzziness between athletic groin pain patients and healthy athletes. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the strategy selection between athletic groin pain patients and healthy athletes. Results: There were no differences between groups in consistency in movement strategy selection (>80%). Athletic groin pain patients tended to select a knee dominant movement strategy whereas healthy athletes preferred an ankle dominant movement strategy. Conclusions: The consistency observed in athletic groin pain patients supports the implementation of movement strategy assessments to inform AGP rehabilitation programmes tailored to athletes’ deficiencies. Such assessments could help enhance the success of athletic groin pain rehabilitation. Differences in movement strategy selection might not be associated with injury state since there were no differences between athletic groin pain patients and healthy athletes. © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - Movement or gait analysis has become a viable assessment tool not only used in sports science or basic biomechanical research, but has also expanded to be a very valuable instrument in clinical diagnostics, monitoring functional recovery and musculoskeletal rehabilitation. In this context, this method has long been an integral part solely in neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy. However, in the meantime the benefits have also become apparent in other medical areas, such as foot surgery, orthopaedic technology, or in patients after lower limb amputation. These procedures proved to better understand, objectify and quantify the individual causes of gait and movement disorders in order to optimize patient-specific therapy. Currently we are able to rely on a multitude of available measurement systems. These can either be used in everyday life for simple monitoring of one's own activity or to complement therapeutic approaches in the clinical and scientific environment. The following review highlights the various fields of movement analysis, including markerless motion capture, marker-based analysis, pedobarography and wearable sensors. Each of these areas presents its own field of application and potential usage as well as the advantages and disadvantages arising in this context. The following article will give an overview of the type of measurement technology used, the respective fields of application, and the selected parameters and their interpretation possibilities for each of the areas mentioned. © 2019

AB  - Humanoid robots promise a better integration of robots into our everyday life, but they come with additional challenges when compared with other mobile robots. We present a novel approach to simplify their usage by handling these challenges with the Humanoid Control Module and show its utility in the RoboCup Soccer Humanoid League. The paper also discusses previous approaches to this problem from inside and outside of the RoboCup domain. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Team Sports Training: The Complexity Model presents a novel approach to team sports training, examining football (soccer), rugby union, field hockey, basketball, handball and futsal through the paradigm of complexity. Under a traditional prism, these sports have been analysed using a deterministic perspective, where the constituent dimensions of the sportsmen were independently examined and treated in isolation. It was expected that the body worked as a perfect machine and, once all the components were maximised, the sportsmen improved their performance. If the same closed recipe was applied to all of the players who formed part of the squad, the global team performance was expected to be enhanced. As much as these reductionist models seem coherent, when contrasted in practice we see that the reality of team sports is far more different from the closed conditions in which they were idealised. Team sports contain variable, heterogeneous and non-linear constraints which require the development of a different logic to organise their training. During the last few years, ecological psychology, the dynamical systems theory or the constraints-led approach have opened interesting fields of research from which many conceptual foundations can be applied to team sports. Based on this contemporary framework, the current book presents the study of the players and the teams as complex systems, using coordination dynamics to explain the emergence of the self-organisation episodes that characterise them. In addition, this thinking line provides the reader with the ability to apply all of these innovative concepts to their practical training scenarios. Altogether, it is intended to challenge the reader to re-think their training strategy and to develop an original theory and practice of training specific to team sports. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: The inclusion of skateboarding in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games reinforces this activity as a sport. As the number of skateboarders around the world and the difficulty of skateboarding maneuvers continue to increase, the number of skateboarding injuries may also rise. Thus, there is a need for more comprehensive investigations into the practice habits and injuries of skateboarders. Purpose: To describe the sports habits and skateboarding injuries of a sample of skateboarders in Spain. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A web-based survey was shared among skateboarders in Spain. The survey collected data related to sports habits, skateboarding practice habits, and injury history. Comparisons between subgroups of sex, age, and experience were also conducted. Results: The survey was completed by 197 participants (89.3% male) with a mean age of 24.4 ± 7.1 years and a mean experience of 9.7 ± 7.2 years. Most respondents (87.8%) reported not participating in any type of skateboarding-specific physical training program. Only 27.4% took part in skateboarding competitions, with a larger number of respondents younger than 18 years participating in competitive events. The mean number of sessions per week was 3.3 ± 1.7, and the mean length of sessions was 3.3 ± 1.5 hours. The majority of participants (87.8%) reported having suffered injuries (n = 323) as a result of skateboarding, mainly affecting the lower limbs (69.7%). The most common injury type was a ligament sprain (39.6%), especially of the ankle (39.3%). This injury was also reported as the most likely to recur (70.1%). A large number of injuries (54.2%) were considered severe (ie, >21 days to recover). Most injuries occurred while skateboarding gaps or stairs, including any type of a jump that involved a difference in height between the take-off and landing surfaces (25.7%). Female participants accounted for a larger number of ligament sprains than expected, and experienced skateboarders were more likely to suffer more severe injuries and head/trunk injuries. Conclusion: Respondents to this survey were mainly young male adults who practiced skateboarding recreationally. Respondents of different sexes, ages, and experiences demonstrated different habits and injury patterns. The greater number of severe injuries highlights the need for injury surveillance in skateboarding to inform better prevention and rehabilitation practices. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Problem Statement and Approach: Although balance skills and personality have been explored in the field of sports science, little is known about the relationship between the two factors. This study aims to investigate the association of postural balance with traits of personality and temperament. Materials and Methods: There were 73 participants in the cross-sectional study between ages 16 and 30 years (M = 21.29, SD = 2.47), and 59% were men. Three samples of participants consisted of Elite Athletes (EA, n = 17, 23.29%) in track and field from the Polish National Team, Football Players (FP, n = 32, 43.84%), and the Control Sample (CS, n = 24, 32.88%). Postural control was assessed on a force platform with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz, whereas personality and temperament were measured using the NEO-FFI and FCB-TI. Results: The EA and CS groups were more stable in the medial-lateral (ML) direction than in the FP group. In the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, the athletes from the EA group were more stable than the CS group. Openness to experience and emotional reactivity were associated with centre of pressure (COP) parameters. Discussion: The results of this study showed that EA and CS showed better stability than footballers in both the ML and AP directions. This study indicates that emotional reactivity as a temperamental trait is associated with postural stability. Among the big five traits of personality, openness solely was found to be related to postural balance skills. Openness is strongly linked with intelligence, which is determined by the efficiency and reliability of the central nervous system and the speed of a neural impulse. Additionally, plasticity as a trait includes openness and extraversion (low emotional reactivity) and may explain the relationship of both personality and temperament traits with balance skills. Conclusions: Openness to experience and emotional reactivity can be explained by postural balance skills. Further research should examine the association of balance skills with plasticity and intelligence. The present research may provide useful clues for sport selection and rehabilitation of sport injuries. Development of openness should be supported in team and individual sports that require excellent balance skills, such as track and field, artistic gymnastics, ice skating, and sky jumping. © JPES.

AB  - Purpose: The authors investigated the association between risk of tendinopathies and genetic markers in professional team sports. Methods: The authors studied 363 (mean [SD]; 25 [6] y, 89% male) elite players (soccer, futsal, basketball, handball, and roller hockey) from a top-level European team (FC Barcelona, Spain). Of 363, 55% (cases) had experienced 1+ episodes of tendinopathy during 2008-2018 and 45% (controls) remained injury free. The authors first examined the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tendinopathy risk in a hypothesis-free case-control genome-wide association study (495,837 SNPs) with additional target analysis of 58 SNPs that are potential candidates to influence tendinopathy risk based on the literature. Thereafter, the authors augmented the SNP set by performing synthetic variant imputation (1,419,369 SNPs) and then used machine learning-based multivariate modeling (support vector machine and random forest) to build a reliable predictive model. Results: Suggestive association (P &lt; 10-5) was found for rs11154027 (gap junction alpha 1), rs4362400 (vesicle amine transport 1-like), and rs10263021 (contactin-associated protein-like 2). Carriage of 1+ variant alleles for rs11154027 (odds ratio = 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.19, P = 1.01 × 10-6) or rs4362400 (odds ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.73, P = 9.6 × 10-6) was associated with a higher risk of tendinopathy, whereas an opposite effect was found for rs10263021 (odds ratio = 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.91], P = 4.5 × 10-6). In the modeling approach, one of the most robust SNPs was rs10477683 in the fibrillin 2 gene encoding fibrillin 2, a component of connective tissue microfibrils involved in elastic fiber assembly. Conclusions: The authors have identified previously undescribed genetic predictors of tendinopathy in elite team sports athletes, notably rs11154027, rs4362400, and rs10263021. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB  - Background: Ankle sprains are one of the most frequent sports injuries. With respect to the high prevalence of ankle ligament injuries and patients' young age, optimizing treatment and rehabilitation is mandatory to prevent future complications such as chronic ankle instability or osteoarthritis. Objective: In modern times, an increasing amount of smartphone usage in patient care is evident. Studies investigating mobile health (mHealth)-based rehabilitation programs after ankle sprains are rare. The aim of this study was to expose any issues present in the development process of a medical app as well as associated risks and chances. Methods: The development process of the Ankle Joint App was defined in chronological order using a protocol. The app's quality was evaluated using the (user) German Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS-G) by voluntary foot and ankle surgeons (n=20) and voluntary athletes (n=20). Results: A multidisciplinary development team built a hybrid app with a corresponding backend structure. The app's content provides actual medical literature, training videos, and a log function. Excellent interrater reliability (interrater reliability=0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.96) was obtained. The mean overall score for the Ankle Joint App was 4.4 (SD 0.5). The mean subjective quality scores were 3.6 (surgeons: SD 0.7) and 3.8 (athletes: SD 0.5). Behavioral change had mean scores of 4.1 (surgeons: SD 0.7) and 4.3 (athletes: SD 0.7). The medical gain value, rated by the surgeons only, was 3.9 (SD 0.6). Conclusions: The data obtained demonstrate that mHealth-based rehabilitation programs might be a useful tool for patient education and collection of personal data. The achieved (user) MARS-G scores support a high quality of the tested app. Medical app development with an a priori defined target group and a precisely intended purpose, in a multidisciplinary team, is highly promising. Follow-up studies are required to obtain funded evidence for the ankle joints app's effects on economical and medical aspects in comparison with established nondigital therapy paths. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common injuries in high-demand sports. Due to long-term treatment of this injury, diagnosing recovery of ACL becomes important, particularly six months postoperatively. The purpose of this research is to provide a cost-effective and intelligent method to diagnose ACL's health status. For this purpose, 11 healthy and 27 ACL-injured subjects have been selected. In the proposed method, the athlete performs a single-leg landing protocol and surface electromyographic signals (EMG) are taken from eight lower limb muscles. Then, time–frequency distributions of EMG signals in each landing are calculated as an image, using pseudo Wigner–Ville distribution (PWVD), which are the inputs of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). By time–frequency analysis, it has been made clear that any change in ACL's health status causes changes in the extent of energy spread in PWVD, distribution volume, frequency content, damping rate and the peak value of EMG signals. In this research, a new relationship between ACL's health status and lower limb muscles activity is introduced through monitoring of PWVD images. The result indicates that the designed expert system is able to diagnose ACL's health status with 95.8% accuracy. In this non-invasive method, PWVD images of EMG signals are chosen as the inputs of DCNN, instead of MRI images, which, in addition to their high accuracy in diagnosing, are safer and much cheaper. The presented method can play an important role in assessing the recovery process, six months postoperatively and after that. © 2019 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences

AB  - Background: Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors frequently analyze only a fraction of the relevant data, and typically not in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value within a time series of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing and size of the peak value of interest. Aims/hypotheses: The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be a shape reflecting an early peak of the knee valgus moment, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have greater early peak frequencies. Methods: N = 213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N = 35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared tests. Results: Six discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had greater frequency of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P < 0.001 for full test). Conclusions: Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data, which likely reflect different movement strategies. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Greater frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher risk of ACL injury in sports. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Over the past four decades, there have been breakthroughs in communication, mobility and tools to manipulate objects. Probably the most important transformation has been the growing inclusion of people with disabilities into the prioritization, conceptualization, and design of new assistive devices. Advances in technology, demands from people with disabilities, and changes in cultural perceptions have made noteworthy changes in the technologies that have improved lives, and affected transformations that benefit both individuals and society. People with disabilities lives have been improved but there is still much to be done. Unfortunately, people with disabilities in low income countries have lagged people in higher income countries in benefitting from technical and social changes. Assistive devices have benefitted from the availability of powerful, portable computing power, from small low-power sensors, from new materials, from rapid prototyping and flexible manufacturing. There are exciting emerging technologies that show promise for future advances. © 2019

AB  - Wei, J., 2019. Injury prevention of knee joint caused by cross-step fall in beach sports. In: Guido-Aldana, P.A. and Mulahasan, S. (eds.), Advances in Water Resources and Exploration. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 542-547. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. In the current beach sports, the research on the injury prevention of knee joint has the problems of poor detection accuracy, long time-consuming, and unsatisfactory treatment effect of knee joint image. In order to solve these problems, the injury prevention method of knee joint caused by beach athlete's cross-step fall based on the PCA-SIFT feature and the Bayesian decision-making is proposed. The TE-WI uncooled focal plane infrared camera is used to capture the knee image of the athlete. The curvelet forward transformation is used to decompose the image into sub-bands of different scales and different directions, and obtain the curvelet coefficients. Generalized cross validation and genetics are used to acquire the asymptotic optimal threshold. The obtained curvelet coefficients are denoised and the image is reconstructed. The denoised image is subjected to the extension processing to enhance the image of the athlete's knee joint. The sample set is randomly selected, and the PCA-SIFT features of each type of image are extracted, and the unstable features are eliminated by the mutual matching rate. Bayesian decision-making is used to classify the images to be classified, and the information about knee joint injuries of athletes is obtained. The prevention and treatment plan is determined according to the damage information. Experiments show that with this method, the image enhancement coefficient is up to 0.99, the athlete's damage detection accuracy is up to 99%, and the damage detection time is the lowest, being 0.42 h. The method has the good image enhancement effect, which improves the accuracy of damage detection and reduces the time required for damage detection. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.

AB  - Objective To assess whether Functional Movement Screen (FMS) score is associated with subsequent injuries in healthy sportspeople. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources The following electronic databases were searched to December 2017: Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, Embase, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligibility criteria included (1) prospective cohort studies that examined the association between FMS score (≤14/21) and subsequent injuries, (2) a sample of healthy and active participants without restrictions in gender or age, and (3) the OR was the effect size and the main outcome. Results Thirteen studies met the criteria for the systematic review and 12 were included in the meta-analysis. In 5 of the 12 studies, and among female athletes in 1 study, FMS score ≤14 out of 21 points was associated with subsequent injuries. The overall OR of the selected studies in the meta-analysis was 1.86 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.61) and showed substantial heterogeneity (I 2 =70%). Summary/Conclusion Whether or not a low FMS score ≤14 out of 21 points is associated with increased risk of injury is unclear. The heterogeneity of the study populations (type of athletes, age and sport exposure) and the definition of injury used in the studies make it difficult to synthesise the evidence and draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Changes of directions and cutting maneuvers, including 180-degree turns, are common locomotor actions in team sports, implying high mechanical load. While the mechanics and neurophysiology of turns have been extensively studied in laboratory conditions, modern inertial measurement units allow us to monitor athletes directly on the field. In this study, we applied four supervised machine learning techniques (linear regression, support vector regression/machine, boosted decision trees and artificial neural networks) to predict turn direction, speed (before/after turn) and the related positive/negative mechanical work. Reference values were computed using an optical motion capture system. We collected data from 13 elite female soccer players performing a shuttle run test, wearing a six-axes inertial sensor at the pelvis level. A set of 18 features (predictors) were obtained from accelerometers, gyroscopes and barometer readings. Turn direction classification returned good results (accuracy &gt;98.4%) with all methods. Support vector regression and neural networks obtained the best performance in the estimation of positive/negative mechanical work (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.42–0.43, mean absolute error = 1.14–1.41 J) and running speed before/after the turns (R2 = 0.66–0.69, mean absolute error = 0.15–018 m/s). Although models can be extended to different angles, we showed that meaningful information on turn kinematics and energetics can be obtained from inertial units with a data-driven approach. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Athletes who wish to resume high-level activities after an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are often advised to undergo surgical reconstruction. Nevertheless, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) does not equate to normal function of the knee or reduced risk of subsequent injuries. In fact, recent evidence has shown that only around half of post-ACLR patients can expect to return to competitive level of sports. A rising concern is the high rate of second ACL injuries, particularly in young athletes, with up to 20% of those returning to sport in the first year from surgery experiencing a second ACL rupture. Aside from the increased risk of second injury, patients after ACLR have an increased risk of developing early onset of osteoarthritis. Given the recent findings, it is imperative that rehabilitation after ACLR is scrutinized so the second injury preventative strategies can be optimized. Unfortunately, current ACLR rehabilitation programs may not be optimally effective in addressing deficits related to the initial injury and the subsequent surgical intervention. Motor learning to (re-)acquire motor skills and neuroplastic capacities are not sufficiently incorporated during traditional rehabilitation, attesting to the high re-injury rates. The purpose of this article is to present novel clinically integrated motor learning principles to support neuroplasticity that can improve patient functional performance and reduce the risk of second ACL injury. The following key concepts to enhance rehabilitation and prepare the patient for re-integration to sports after an ACL injury that is as safe as possible are presented: (1) external focus of attention, (2) implicit learning, (3) differential learning, (4) self-controlled learning and contextual interference. The novel motor learning principles presented in this manuscript may optimize future rehabilitation programs to reduce second ACL injury risk and early development of osteoarthritis by targeting changes in neural networks. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Musculoskeletal injury rates in military personnel remain unacceptably high. Application of machine learning algorithms could be useful in multivariate models to predict injury in this population. The purpose of this study was to investigate if interaction between individual predictors, using a decision tree model, could be used to develop a population-specific algorithm of lower-extremity injury (LEI) risk. Methods: One hundred forty Air Force Special Forces Operators (27.4 ± 5.0 yr, 177.6 ± 5.8 cm, 83.8 ± 8.4 kg) volunteered for this prospective cohort study. Baseline testing included body composition, isokinetic strength, flexibility, aerobic/anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, and landing biomechanics. To evaluate unilateral landing patterns, subjects jumped off two-feet from a distance (40% of their height) over a hurdle and landing single-legged on a force plate. Medical chart reviews were conducted 365 d postbaseline. χ 2 automatic interaction detection (CHAID) was used, which compares predictor variables to LEI and assigns a population-specific "cut-point" for the most relevant predictors. Results: Twenty-seven percent of operators (n = 38) suffered LEI. A maximum knee flexion angle difference of 25.1% had the highest association with injury in this population (P = 0.006). Operators with &gt;25.1% differences in max knee flexion angle (n = 13) suffered LEI at a 69.2% rate. Seven of the 13 Operators with &gt;25.1% difference in max knee flexion angle weighed &gt;81.8 kg, and 100% of those operators suffered LEI (P = 0.047; n = 7). Only 33% of operators with &gt;25.1% difference in max knee flexion angle that weighed &lt;81.8 kg suffered LEI. Conclusions: This study demonstrated increased risk of LEI over a 365-d period in Operators with greater differences in single-leg landing strategies and higher body mass. The CHAID approach can be a powerful tool to analyze population-specific risk factors for injury, along with how those factors may interact to enhance risk.

AB  - Training to reduce landing forces is a common component of anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programmes. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of training incorporating instructions promoting an internal versus external attentional focus on landing forces in adolescent rugby athletes. Twenty-two rugby athletes were randomly allocated to groups that received instructions promoting an internal versus an external focus during a two week training programme. Landing forces were recorded before and after completion of the programme. During follow-up testing, landings were performed with and without a secondary cognitive task. Both groups exhibited a similar reduction in landing forces following training for trials performed without the secondary cognitive task. However, the groups responded differently when the secondary cognitive task was imposed. Athletes who were trained with an internal focus demonstrated a prominent increase in landing forces for trials that included the secondary cognitive task (vs. trials performed without the secondary cognitive task), whereas the secondary cognitive task had minimal influence for athletes who were trained with an external focus. It appears that training with an external focus may promote adaptations in landing mechanics that can be implemented more automatically. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biomechanical feedback is a relevant key to improving sports and arts performance. Yet, the bibliometric keyword analysis onWeb of Science publications reveals that, when comparing to other biofeedback applications, the real-time biomechanical feedback application lags far behind in sports and arts practice. While real-time physiological and biochemical biofeedback have seen routine applications, the use of real-time biomechanical feedback in motor learning and training is still rare. On that account, the paper aims to extract the specific research areas, such as three-dimensional (3D) motion capture, anthropometry, biomechanical modeling, sensing technology, and artificial intelligent (AI)/deep learning, which could contribute to the development of the real-time biomechanical feedback system. The review summarizes the past and current state of biomechanical feedback studies in sports and arts performance; and, by integrating the results of the studies with the contemporary wearable technology, proposes a two-chain body model monitoring using six IMUs (inertial measurement unit) with deep learning technology. The framework can serve as a basis for a breakthrough in the development. The review indicates that the vital step in the development is to establish a massive data, which could be obtained by using the synchronized measurement of 3D motion capture and IMUs, and that should cover diverse sports and arts skills. As such, wearables powered by deep learning models trained by the massive and diverse datasets can supply a feasible, reliable, and practical biomechanical feedback for athletic and artistic training. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this article, we review skeletal muscle strain injury with computational methods for strain injury analysis, prevention, and recovery. We first review the theory of muscle strain injury at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. Next, we discuss simulation models, including kinematics, dynamics, and finite-element method. Finally, we introduce predictive approaches for muscle strain injury prevention. Topics including recovery, rehabilitation, muscle-tendon remodeling, and experimental methods are described. We also suggest areas for future research. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) is very common in military personnel resulting in mental anomalies and interfering with decision-making capabilities. Moreover during combat operation, these sleep-deprived soldiers often receive blunt head trauma casing concussive head injury (CHI). Recent observations clearly suggest that SD alone induces brain pathology and additional CHI further exacerbates brain damage. Thus, the need of the hour is to explore possible effective therapeutic measures to induce neuroprotection to enhance quality of life of these military personnel. This review deals with novel aspects of treatment using nanotechnology to induce superior neuroprotection following CHI in SD based on our own investigation in the light of recent literature in the field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Disuse muscle wasting will likely affect everyone in his or her lifetime in response to pathologies such as joint immobilization, inactivity or bed rest. There are no good therapies to treat it. We previously found that allopurinol, a drug widely used to treat gout, protects muscle damage after exhaustive exercise and results in functional gains in old individuals. Thus, we decided to test its effect in the prevention of soleus muscle atrophy after two weeks of hindlimb unloading in mice, and lower leg immobilization following ankle sprain in humans (EudraCT: 2011-003541-17). Our results show that allopurinol partially protects against muscle atrophy in both mice and humans. The protective effect of allopurinol is similar to that of resistance exercise which is the best-known way to prevent muscle mass loss in disuse human models. We report that allopurinol protects against the loss of muscle mass by inhibiting the expression of ubiquitin ligases. Our results suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is an appropriate therapeutic target to inhibit muscle wasting and emphasizes the role of allopurinol as a non-hormonal intervention to treat disuse muscle atrophy. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In order to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) several methods have been developed, accepted by the international literature and used in the workplace. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe recent implementations of wearable sensors for quantitative instrumental-based biomechanical risk assessments in prevention of WMSDs. Methods: Articles written until 7 May 2018 were selected from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science using specific keywords. Results: Instrumental approaches based on inertial measurement units and sEMG sensors have been used for direct evaluations to classify lifting tasks into low and high risk categories. Wearable sensors have also been used for direct instrumental evaluations in handling of low loads at high frequency activities by using the local myoelectric manifestation of muscle fatigue estimation. In the field of the rating of standard methods, on-body wireless sensors network-based approaches for real-time ergonomic assessment in industrial manufacturing have been proposed. Conclusions: Few studies foresee the use of wearable technologies for biomechanical risk assessment although the requirement to obtain increasingly quantitative evaluations, the recent miniaturization process and the need to follow a constantly evolving manual handling scenario is prompting their use. © 2018, MDPI AG.

AB  - Children in hospital are subjected to multiple negative stimuli that may hinder their development and social interactions. Although game technologies are thought to improve children's experience in hospital, there is a lack of information on how they can be used effectively. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the existing approaches in this context to identify gaps for future research. A total of 1305 studies were identified, of which 75 were thoroughly analyzed according to our review protocol. The results show that the most common approach is to design mono-user games with traditional computers or monitor-based video consoles, which serve as a distractor or a motivator for physical rehabilitation for primary school children undergoing fearful procedures such as venipuncture, or those suffering chronic, neurological, or traumatic diseases/injures. We conclude that, on the one hand, game technologies seem to present physical and psychological benefits to pediatric patients, but more research is needed on this. On the other hand, future designers of games for pediatric hospitalization should consider: 1. The development for kindergarten patients and adolescents, 2. Address the psychological impact caused by long-term hospitalization, 3. Use collaboration as an effective game strategy to reduce patient isolation, 4. Have purposes other than distraction, such as socialization, coping with emotions, or fostering physical mobility, 5. Include parents/caregivers and hospital staff in the game activities; and 6. Exploit new technological artifacts such as robots and tangible interactive elements to encourage intrinsic motivation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An understanding of the scientific principles underpinning the learning and execution of fundamental and skilled movements is of central importance in disciplines across the sport and exercise sciences. The second edition of Motor Control, Learning and Development: Instant Notes offers students an accessible, clear and concise introduction to the core concepts of motor behavior, from learning through to developing expertise. Including two brand new chapters on implicit versus explicit learning and motor control and aging, this new edition is fully revised and updated, and covers: definitions, theories and measurements of motor control; information processing, neurological issues and sensory factors in control; theories and stages of motor learning; memory and feedback; the development of fundamental movement skills; and the application of theory to coaching and rehabilitation practice. Highly illustrated and well-formatted, the book allows readers to grasp complex ideas quickly, through learning objectives, research highlights, review questions and activities, and encourages students to deepen their understanding through further reading suggestions. This is important foundational reading for any student taking classes in motor control, learning or behavior or skill acquisition, or a clear and concise reference for any practicing sports coach, physical education teacher or rehabilitation specialist. © 2019 Andrea Utley.

AB  - Ankle sprain is a common trauma, most patients can recover by non-surgical treatments. However, prolonged immobilization of ankle sprains is a common treatment error. After ankle sprain, patients should keep rehabilitation exercises to recover to the same level as before. There are 3 stages of ankle rehabilitation training process. This paper focuses on the second stage - proprioceptive training of intermediate functional rehabilitation. The normal training exercise of the second stage is balance training, bilateral and unilateral stance on different surfaces, which has been verified effective by large experimental data. Although balance training is simple and convenient, people can hardly complete the required amount of training because of the monotonous process. Therefore, although the medical research in ankle rehabilitation is well developed, the ankle rehabilitation training is not effective nor efficient enough. This paper shows a way to improve the effects and experiences of ankle rehabilitation process through interactive design and gamification. The interactive training system consists of 2 parts, the multi-touch pressure sensor and the user interface. The sensor can acquire the data of users’ feet pressure distribution, which can be used to judge if the user is doing the proper training action. The user interface can give users instant feedback by game elements. Users can control the movement of the game subject by feet force changes (The pressure data are processed to apply to the game control module) to win the awards and avoid the obstacles. Each time the users succeed a game, they complete a training task at the same time. A user test was implemented for the interactive training system. According to the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction result by questionnaires, the users showed high satisfaction of the training process and outcome. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Researches have been performed to investigate the effects of phototherapy on improving performance and reduction of muscular fatigue. However, a great variability in the light parameters and protocols of the trials are a concern to establish the efficacy of this therapy to be used in sports or clinic. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, moment of application of phototherapy within an exercise protocol, and which are the parameters optimally effective for the improvement of muscular performance and the reduction of muscular fatigue in healthy people. Systematic searches of PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were conducted for randomized clinical trials to March 2017. Analyses of risk of bias and quality of evidence of the included trials were performed, and authors were contacted to obtain any missing or unclear information. We included 39 trials (861 participants). Data were reported descriptively through tables, and 28 trials were included in meta-analysis comparing outcomes to placebo. Meta-analysis was performed for the variables: time until reach exhaustion, number of repetitions, isometric peak torque, and blood lactate levels showing a very low to moderate quality of evidence and some effect in favor to phototherapy. Further investigation is required due the lack of methodological quality, small sample size, great variability of exercise protocols, and phototherapy parameters. In general, positive results were found using both low-level laser therapy and light-emitting diode therapy or combination of both in a wavelength range from 655 to 950 nm. Most of positive results were observed with an energy dose range from 20 to 60 J for small muscular groups and 60 to 300 J for large muscular groups and maximal power output of 200 mW per diode. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a framework to classify work poses among groups of masons during the building of a standard wall of concrete masonry units. The experience of the group composed of masonry instructors and master masons averaged five times that of the other groups, their productivity was highest, and the loads on their joints were the lowest. Thus, they were deemed experts in this paper. Inertial measurement units (IMU) and video cameras were used to collect kinematic data of the masons, from which pose clusters were identified. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify masons' poses into expert and inexpert classes based on the relative frequency of poses in the motions used to lay each of 945 masonry units. Two classification scenarios were tested. While both scenarios achieved similar levels of accuracy, 91.23% and 92.04% respectively, the processing time for binary classification was only 13 s compared to 523 s for inter-group multiclass SVM. Like characteristic vibration frequencies in machine diagnostics and system identification, the characteristic poses identified provide insight into differing methods between expert and less experienced masons. For example, results show that experts utilize fewer and more ergonomicaly safe poses, while being more productive, which indicates lower energy expenditure (less wasted motions). The classification method and the poses identified contribute knowledge to help develop affordable mason training systems that utilize IMU and video feedback to improve health and productivity of apprentice masons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Analysis of in-shoe pressure distribution during sport-specific movements may provide a clue to improve shoe design and prevent injuries. This study compared the mean and the peak pressures over the whole foot and ten separate areas of the foot, wearing different shoes during specific movements. Methods: Nine male adult recreational futsal players performed three trials of three sport-specific movements (shuffle, sprint and penalty kick), while they were wearing three brands of futsal shoes (Adidas, Lotto and Tiger). Plantar pressures on dominant feet were collected using the F-SCAN system. Peak and mean pressures for whole foot and each separate area were extracted. For statistical analysis, the mean differences in outcome variables between different shoes and movements were estimated using random-effects regression model using STATA ver.10. Results: In the average calculation of the three movements, the peak pressure on the whole foot in Adidas shoe was less than Lotto [8.8% (CI95%: 4.1–13.6%)] and Tiger shoes [11.8% (CI95%:7–16.7%)], (P<0.001). Also, the recorded peak pressure on the whole foot in penalty kick was 61.1% (CI95%: 56.3–65.9%) and 57.6% (CI95%: 52.8–62.3%) less than Shuffle and Sprint tests, respectively (P<0.001). Conclusion: Areas with the highest peak pressure during all 3 movements were not different between all shoes. This area was medial forefoot in cases of shuffle and sprint movements and medial heel in case of penalty kick. © 2017 Teymouri et al.

AB  - Anthropometric dimensions, such as lengths, heights, breadths, circumferences and their ratios are highly significant in healthcare, security, sports, clothing, tools and equipment industry. In this study, an automatic and precise method for anthropometric dimensions of human body using two-dimensional images is proposed. The dimensions are obtained by using fiducial points that are detected from frontal and lateral views of body silhouettes. Primary anthropometric dimensions, which include heights, breadths, depths and lengths, are obtained by calculating the difference between two relevant fiducial points. The secondary dimensions: ratios are obtained directly from primary dimensions, and circumference dimensions are estimated precisely using ellipsoid model. A total of 75, i.e. 51 primary and 24 secondary dimensions are obtained, which are three times the number acquired by the state-of-the-art method. The accuracy of acquired dimensions is verified by comparing it with the manual measurements by using the standard parameter of maximum allowable error. It is found that mean absolute difference of all the dimensions, obtained by the proposed method, lie within the limits of maximum allowable error. More importantly, the mean absolute difference for the majority of dimensions (20 out of 24) is significantly less for proposed method as compared with the best method in existing literature. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the influence of different bike positions on the perception of fatigue, pain and comfort. Twenty cyclists underwent three tests that involved cycling for 45 min at their individual 50% peak aerobic power output while adopting different positions on the bike. Participants performed the cycling tests adopting three positions defined by two parameters (knee flexion angle [20°, 30°, 40°] and trunk flexion angle [35°, 45°, 55°]) in random order. Angles were measured using a 2D motion analysis system during cycling and applying Fonda’s correction factor. Perceptions of comfort, fatigue and pain were reported before the end of each test. The combination of 40° knee flexion and 35° trunk flexion was perceived as the most uncomfortable position. Moreover, greater knee flexion had a negative effect on trunk comfort, accompanied by greater levels of fatigue and pain perception in the anterior part of the thigh and knee. In conclusion, cyclists perceived the most comfortable position to be when the saddle height was within the recommended knee angle (30° calculated from the offset position or 40 ± 4.0° of absolute value). Upright trunk was found to be the most comfortable position for recreational cyclists, where aerodynamics is not so important. Cyclists’ bike perceptions should be taken into account when it comes to choosing the most beneficial position, since this can play a role in injury prevention and enhance cycling performance. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The goal of the current study was to expand on previous work to validate the use of pressure insole technology in conjunction with linear regression models to predict the free torque at the shoe–surface interface that is generated while wearing different athletic shoes. Three distinctly different shoe designs were utilised. The stiffness of each shoe was determined with a material’s testing machine. Six participants wore each shoe that was fitted with an insole pressure measurement device and performed rotation trials on an embedded force plate. A pressure sensor mask was constructed from those sensors having a high linear correlation with free torque values. Linear regression models were developed to predict free torques from these pressure sensor data. The models were able to accurately predict their own free torque well (RMS error 3.72 ± 0.74 Nm), but not that of the other shoes (RMS error 10.43 ± 3.79 Nm). Models performing self-prediction were also able to measure differences in shoe stiffness. The results of the current study showed the need for participant–shoe specific linear regression models to insure high prediction accuracy of free torques from pressure sensor data during isolated internal and external rotations of the body with respect to a planted foot. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A direct method to express the center of pressure (CoP) measured by an insole pressure sensor system (IPSS) into a known coordinate system measured by motion tracking equipment is presented. A custom probe was constructed with reflective markers to allow its tip to be precisely tracked with motion tracking equipment. This probe was utilized to activate individual sensors on an IPSS that was placed in a shoe fitted with reflective markers used to establish a local shoe coordinate system. When pressed onto the IPSS the location of the probe's tip was coincident with the CoP measured by the IPSS (IPSS-CoP). Two separate pushes (i.e., data points) were used to develop vectors in each respective coordinate system. Simple vector mathematics determined the rotational and translational components of the transformation matrix needed to express the IPSS-CoP into the local shoe coordinate system. Validation was performed by comparing IPSS-CoP with an embedded force plate measured CoP (FP-CoP) from data gathered during kinematic trials. Six male subjects stood on an embedded FP and performed anterior/posterior (AP) sway, internal rotation, and external rotation of the body relative to a firmly planted foot. The IPSS-CoP was highly correlated with the FP-CoP for all motions, root mean square errors (RMSRRs) were comparable to other research, and there were no statistical differences between the displacement of the IPSS-CoP and FP-CoP for both the AP and medial/lateral (ML) axes, respectively. The results demonstrated that this methodology could be utilized to determine the transformation variables need to express IPSS-CoP into a known coordinate system measured by motion tracking equipment and that these variables can be determined outside the laboratory anywhere motion tracking equipment is available. © 2016 by ASME.

AB  - Golf requires proper dynamic balance to accurately control the club head through a harmonious coordination of each human segment and joint. In this study, we evaluated the ability for dynamic balance during a golf swing by using the centre of mass (COM)–centre of pressure (COP) inclination variables. Twelve professional, 13 amateur and 10 novice golfers participated in this study. Six infrared cameras, two force platforms and SB-Clinic software were used to measure the net COM and COP trajectories. In order to evaluate dynamic balance ability, the COM–COP inclination angle, COM–COP inclination angular velocity and normalised COM–COP inclination angular jerk were used. Professional golfer group revealed a smaller COM–COP inclination angle and angular velocity than novice golfer group in the lead/trail direction (P < 0.01). In the normalised COM–COP inclination angular jerk, the professional golfer group showed a lower value than the other two groups in all directions. Professional golfers tend to exhibit improved dynamic balance, and this can be attributed to the neuromusculoskeletal system that maintains balance with proper postural control. This study has the potential to allow for an evaluation of the dynamic balance mechanism and will provide useful basic information for swing training and prevention of golf injuries. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Knee alignment measurements are one of the most extended indicators of knee-complex injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament injury and patellofemoral pain syndrome. The Frontal Plane Projection Angle (FPPA) is widely used as a 2-D estimation of knee alignment. However, traditional procedures to measure this angle suffer from practical limitations, which leads to huge time investments when evaluating multiple subjects. This work presents a novel video analysis system aimed at supporting experts in the dynamic measurement of the FPPA in a cost-effective and easy way. The system employs Kinect V2 depth sensor to track reflective markers attached to the patient leg joints to provide an automatic estimation of the angle formed by the hip, knee and ankle joints. Information registered by the sensor is processed and managed by a computer application that simplifies expert’s work and expedites the analysis of the test results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Background: It has frequently been reported that balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power are associated with sports-related and everyday activities. Knowledge about the relationship between balance, strength, and power are important for the identification of at-risk individuals because deficits in these neuromuscular components are associated with an increased risk of sustaining injuries and falls. In addition, this knowledge is of high relevance for the development of specifically tailored health and skill-related exercise programs. Objectives: The objectives of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis were to characterize and, if possible, quantify associations between variables of balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power in healthy individuals across the lifespan. Data Sources: A computerized systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus up to March 2015 to capture all relevant articles. Study Eligibility Criteria: A systematic approach was used to evaluate the 996 articles identified for initial review. Studies were included only if they investigated healthy individuals aged ≥6 years and tested at least one measure of static steady-state balance (e.g., center of pressure [CoP] displacement during one-legged stance), dynamic steady-state balance (e.g., gait speed), proactive balance (e.g., distance in the functional-reach-test), or reactive balance (e.g., CoP displacement during perturbed one-legged stance), and one measure of maximal strength (e.g., maximum voluntary contraction), explosive force (e.g., rate of force development), or muscle power (e.g., jump height). In total, 37 studies met the inclusionary criteria for review. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: The included studies were coded for the following criteria: age (i.e., children: 6–12 years, adolescents: 13–18 years, young adults: 19–44 years, middle-aged adults: 45–64 years, old adults: ≥65 years), sex (i.e., female, male), and test modality/outcome (i.e., test for the assessment of balance, strength, and power). Studies with athletes, patients, and/or people with diseases were excluded. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were extracted, transformed (i.e., Fisher’s z-transformed rz value), aggregated (i.e., weighted mean rz value), back-transformed to r values, classified according to their magnitude (i.e., small: r ≤ 0.69, medium: r ≤ 0.89, large: r ≥ 0.90), and, if possible, statistically compared. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2 and Chi-squared (χ2) statistics. Results: Three studies examined associations between balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power in children, one study in adolescents, nine studies in young adults, three studies in middle-aged adults, and 23 studies in old adults. Overall, small-sized associations were found between variables of balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power, irrespective of the age group considered. In addition, small-sized but significantly larger correlation coefficients were found between measures of dynamic steady-state balance and maximal strength in children (r = 0.57) compared with young (r = 0.09, z = 3.30, p = 0.001) and old adults (r = 0.35, z = 2.94, p = 0.002) as well as in old compared with young adults (z = 1.95, p = 0.03). Limitations: Even though the reported results provided further insight into the associations between measures of balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power, they did not allow us to deduce cause and effect relations. Further, the investigated associations could be biased by other variables such as joint flexibility, muscle mass, and/or auditory/visual acuity. Conclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed predominately small-sized correlations between measures of balance and lower-extremity muscle strength/power in children, adolescents, and young, middle-aged, and old adults. This indicates that these neuromuscular components are independent of each other and should therefore be tested and trained complementarily across the lifespan. Significantly larger but still small-sized associations were found between measures of dynamic steady-state balance and maximal strength in children compared with young and old adults as well as in old compared with young adults. These findings imply that age/maturation may have an impact on the association of selected components of balance and lower-extremity muscle strength. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Aim. Gait efficiency is used to evaluate energy consumption especially in patients with movement disorders. This study compared the physiological and mechanical measures of gait efficiency between patients with ACL reconstruction (ACLR) following rehabilitation and healthy controls and correlated among these measures. Methods. Seventeen patients with ACLR and sixteen healthy controls participated in the study. A 3D motion analysis system was used for collecting the mechanical measures while the physiological measures were collected after performing the 6-minute walking test. Results. MANOVA showed that the knee internal rotation, Physiological Cost Index (PCI) and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) increased and the speed of walking decreased significantly in the patients compared with the controls with no significant difference for the Biomechanical Efficiency Quotient (BEQ). There were significant positive correlations between each of the PCI & RPE and each of the BEQ, speed of walking and knee internal rotation in each group. Conclusion. There are alterations in both mechanical and physiological measures of gait efficiency in patients with ACLR following rehabilitation, clarifying the need for performing additional endurance as well as knee stability training programs. The positive correlations indicate that using either of the mechanical or physiological measures for evaluating gait efficiency is acceptable.

AB  - The aim of the present review is to investigate the main field-based tests, used alone or included in sport or fitness batteries, for the assessment of health- and skill-related physical fitness components in adolescents. Different scientific databases were searched through using the selected key words related to physical fitness and its components for adolescence. The search focused on original articles and reviews/meta-analyses using valid, reproducible and feasible tests that fit within the school environment. A total of 100 scientific manuscripts were included in the qualitative synthesis. The present systematic review pointed out 5 fitness tests that well adapt to the evaluation of the components of physical fitness of adolescents within a school environment: the 20 m shuttle run test for cardio-respiratory endurance; the handgrip strength test for upper body maximal strength; the standing broad jump test for lower body maximal strength; the sit-up test to exhaustion for muscular endurance and the 4±10 m shuttle run test for speed, agility and coordination. These fitness tests have been finally selected and incorporated into the Adolescents and Surveillance System for the Obesity prevention - Fitness Test Battery (ASSO-FTB), and will be adopted within the ASSO Project for evaluation purposes. This instrument could be also provided to teachers and people working in schools in order to assess physical fitness of adolescents over time and prevent obesity and related diseases.

AB  - The rapid growth in the field of artificial intelligence from past one decade has a significant impact on various application areas i.e. health, security, home appliances among many. In this paper we aim to review artificial intelligence methodologies and their potential applications intended for variable purposes i.e. Agriculture, applied sciences, business, engineering, finance, management etc. For this purpose articles from past one decade (from 2004 to 2013) are reviewed in order to explore the most recent research advancements in this domain. The review includes 172 articles gathered from related sources including conference proceedings and academic journals. We have categorized the selected articles into four main categories i.e. fuzzy systems, neural network based systems, neuro fuzzy systems and expert systems. Furthermore, expert systems are further classified into three categories: (i) rule based expert systems, (ii) knowledge based expert systems and (iii) intelligent agents. This review presents research implications for practitioners regarding integration of artificial intelligence techniques with classical approaches and suggestions for exploration of AI techniques in variable applications. © Rinton Press.

AB  - Over the past few decades the increased level of public awareness concerning healthcare, physical activities, safety and environmental sensing has created an emerging need for smart sensor technologies and monitoring devices able to sense, classify, and provide feedbacks to users’ health status and physical activities, as well as to evaluate environmental and safety conditions in a pervasive, accurate and reliable fashion. Monitoring and precisely quantifying users’ physical activity with inertial measurement unit-based devices, for instance, has also proven to be important in health management of patients affected by chronic diseases, e.g., Parkinson’s disease, many of which are becoming highly prevalent in Italy and in the Western world. This review paper will focus on MEMS sensor technologies developed in Italy in the last three years describing research achievements for healthcare and physical activity, safety and environmental sensing, in addition to smart systems integration. Innovative and smart integrated solutions for sensing devices, pursued and implemented in Italian research centres, will be highlighted, together with specific applications of such technologies. Finally, the paper will depict the future perspective of sensor technologies and corresponding exploitation opportunities, again with a specific focus on Italy. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Infrared thermography (IRT) is a safe and non-invasive tool used for examining physiological functions based on skin temperature (Tsk) control. The aim of this paper was to establish the probable thermal difference between the beginning and the end of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation process after surgery. For this purpose thermograms from 25 ACL surgically operated patients (2 women, 23 men) were taken on the first and last day of a six-week rehabilitation program. A FLIR infrared camera according to the protocol established by the International Academy of Clinical Thermology (IACT). The results showed significant temperature increases in the posterior thigh area between the first and the last week of the rehabilitation process probably due to a compensatory mechanism. According to this, we can conclude that temperature of the posterior area of the injured and non-injured leg has increased from the first to the last day of the rehabilitation process.

AB  - The aim of this work was to analyze the postural sway of volleyball players in bipedal quiet stance. The center of pressure (CoP) was measured in 46 athletes and 42 non-athlete controls. Each subject was tested in 10 different conditions, 5 with their eyes open and 5 with their eyes closed. Volleyball players showed greater CoP ellipses, suggesting a different model of sensory integration in their postural stability. A multivariate approach to data analysis demonstrated that the postural sway of the two groups was different when the subjects kept their eyes open, but it was not with visual deprivation. This could partially be explained by the better 'dynamic' visual acuity of athletes, since possible ('static') refractive errors were corrected for both groups. Furthermore, we expected that national players, engaged in more intensive training programs, were more different from controls than regional ones, and that defensive players, whose role requires the quickest reaction times, were more different from controls than hitters. Our results confirmed these hypothesis. The protocol presented might be useful to assess the efficacy of intensive sport training programs and/or to select elite players with an aptitude for a specific playing position. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human surrogates are representations of living human structures employed to replicate "real-life" injurious scenarios in artificial environments. They are used primarily to evaluate personal protective equipment (PPE) or integrated safety systems (e.g., seat belts) in a wide range of industry sectors (e.g., automotive, military, security service, and sports equipment). Surrogates are commonly considered in five major categories relative to their form and functionality: human volunteers, postmortem human surrogates, animal surrogates, anthropomorphic test devices, and computational models. Each surrogate has its relative merits. Surrogates have been extensively employed in scenarios concerning "life-threatening" impacts (e.g., penetrating bullets or automotive accidents). However, more frequently occurring nonlethal injuries (e.g., fractures, tears, lacerations, contusions) often result in full or partial debilitation in contexts where optimal human performance is crucial (e.g., military, sports). Detailed study of these injuries requires human surrogates with superior biofidelity to those currently available if PPE designs are to improve. The opportunities afforded by new technologies, materials, instrumentation, and processing capabilities should be exploited to develop a new generation of more sophisticated human surrogates. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in human surrogate construction, highlighting weaknesses and opportunities, to promote research into improved surrogates for PPE development. © 2013 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To understand why professional female ballet dancers often complain of inguinal pain and experience early hip osteoarthritis (OA). Goals were to examine clinical and advanced imaging findings in the hips of dancers compared with those in a matched cohort of nondancers and to assess the femoral head translation in the forward split position using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Twenty professional female ballet dancers and 14 active healthy female individuals matched for age (control group) completed a questionnaire on hip pain and underwent hip examination with impingement tests and measurement of passive hip range of motion (ROM). All had a pelvic 1.5 T MRI in the back-lying position to assess femoroacetabular morphologic features and lesions. For the dancers, additional MR images were acquired in the split position to evaluate femoroacetabular congruency. Results: Twelve of 20 dancers complained of groin pain only while dancing; controls were asymptomatic. Dancers' passive hip ROM was normal. No differences in α neck angle, acetabular depth, acetabular version, and femoral neck anteversion were found between dancers and controls. MRI of dancers while performing splits showed a mean femoral head subluxation of 2.05 mm. MRI of dancers' hips showed labral tears, cartilage thinning, and herniation pits, located in superior and posterosuperior positions. Lesions were the same for symptomatic and asymptomatic dancers. Controls had proportionally the same number of labral lesions but in an anterosuperior position. They also had 2 to 3 times fewer cartilage lesions and pits than did dancers. Conclusions: The results of our study are consistent with our hypothesis that repetitive extreme movements can cause femoral head subluxations and femoroacetabular abutments in female ballet dancers with normal hip morphologic features, which could result in early OA. Pathologic changes seen on MRI were symptomatic in less than two thirds of the dancers. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series. © 2013 by the Arthroscopy Association of North America.

AB  - Simulate realistic human motion in a virtual world with an optimization-based approach to motion prediction. With this approach, motion is governed by human performance measures, such as speed and energy, which act as objective functions to be optimized. Constraints on joint torques and angles are imposed quite easily. Predicting motion in this way allows one to use avatars to study how and why humans move the way they do, given specific scenarios. It also enables avatars to react to infinitely many scenarios with substantial autonomy. With this approach it is possible to predict dynamic motion without having to integrate equations of motion -- rather than solving equations of motion, this approach solves for a continuous time-dependent curve characterizing joint variables (also called joint profiles) for every degree of freedom. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed at confirming whether Motor Imagery (MI) enhances tennis serve performance, and determining whether a placebo condition could affect the beneficial effects of MI. Design: This study used a 3 × 2 factorial design. Three groups of tennis players were compared in service performance outcomes before and after a training session. Methods: Twenty-two tennis players were assigned into three groups: a control (C) and two experimental groups subjected to a similar MI intervention, one group using their regular own racket (MI group) while the other used a placebo racket (P group). Results: Analyses of Covariance revealed no significant group difference when comparing serve velocity after training session, but MI training improved serve accuracy and regularity. Combining placebo racket with MI further resulted in greater serve accuracy score as compared to MI alone. Players' perception of their serve quality improved after MI, and this effect was reinforced in the P group. Conclusion: These findings revealed that MI may be useful to achieve peak performance, and that the implement placebo effect might be a factor in sport performance, hence promoting the beneficial effects of alternative methods to improve tennis serve performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Virtual Reality has the potential to provide descriptive and practical information for medical training and therapy while relieving the patient or the physician. Multimodal interactions between the user and the virtual environment facilitate the generation of high-fidelity sensory impressions, by using not only visual and auditory, but also kinesthetic, tactile, and even olfactory feedback modalities. On the basis of the existing physiological constraints, Virtual Reality in Medicine derives the technical requirements and design principles of multimodal input devices, displays, and rendering techniques. Resulting from a course taught by the authors, Virtual Reality in Medicine presents examples for surgical training, intra-operative augmentation, and rehabilitation that are already in use as well as those currently in development. It is well suited as introductory material for engineering and computer science students, as well as researchers who want to learn more about basic technologies in the area of virtual reality applied to medicine. It also provides a broad overview to non-engineering students as well as clinical users, who desire to learn more about the current state of the art and future applications of this technology. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.

AB  - Foot plantar pressure is the pressure field that acts between the foot and the support surface during everyday locomotor activities. Information derived from such pressure measures is important in gait and posture research for diagnosing lower limb problems, footwear design, sport biomechanics, injury prevention and other applications. This paper reviews foot plantar sensors characteristics as reported in the literature in addition to foot plantar pressure measurement systems applied to a variety of research problems. Strengths and limitations of current systems are discussed and a wireless foot plantar pressure system is proposed suitable for measuring high pressure distributions under the foot with high accuracy and reliability. The novel system is based on highly linear pressure sensors with no hysteresis. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cinematographic techniques are not well suited to determine the forces and accelerations experienced during locomotion and sports activities. Transducers are necessary to provide accurate data for these mechanical quantities. Ground reaction forces and the path of the centre of gravity can be determined with force platforms. These data are used to estimate internal and external loads on the body, its bones, muscles, and joints during locomotion and sports activities. However, the knowledge of the ground reaction forces provides no information about the stress, acting on various anatomical foot structures. The understanding of the etiology of foot stress fractures, for example, requires a more detailed analysis of foot loading. Many separate force measuring sensors that cover the area of contact between the foot and the ground provide this information. For many years, researchers have explored methods to measure pressure distribution. Nowadays, different commercial pressure measuring devices are available, and the determination of static and dynamic pressure distribution patterns under the foot has become a standard evaluation tool for clinical applications and footwear design. The knowledge of individual foot loading characteristics is important for clinical applications and the prescription of orthotic devices and therapeutic footwear. Excessive pressures under the foot may lead to ulcers in neuropathic feet, as they can be present at the later stages of diabetes. To avoid these high plantar loads, in-shoe pressure distribution measurements are widely used for the prescription of footwear and orthotics for diabetic patients. Plantar pressures are closely related to shoe comfort. Therefore, many athletic footwear companies use pressure distribution measuring devices in the process of designing new products. For example, the “Nike Free” footwear concept is based on the plantar pressure pattern from barefoot running on natural grass. Several stages of sole modifications were built until the same in-shoe pressure patterns were measured as found during barefoot running on grass. After a short historical review, different transducer technologies, plantar pressure variables, and the reliability of pressure distribution measurements will be discussed in the following pages. The use of pressure distribution in the design and testing of casual, athletic, and therapeutic footwear will conclude this chapter. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Providing a solid foundation in the normal development of functional movement, Functional Movement Development Across the Life Span, 3rd Edition helps you recognize and understand movement disorders and effectively manage patients with abnormal motor function. It begins with coverage of basic theory, motor development and motor control, and evaluation of function, then discusses the body systems contributing to functional movement, and defines functional movement outcomes in terms of age, vital functions, posture and balance, locomotion, prehension, and health and illness. This edition includes more clinical examples and applications, and updates data relating to typical performance on standardized tests of balance. Written by physical therapy experts Donna J. Cech and Suzanne "Tink" Martin, this book provides evidence-based information and tools you need to understand functional movement and manage patients' functional skills throughout the life span. Over 200 illustrations, tables, and features reinforce the text and help to clarify difficult concepts. A focus on evidence-based information covers development changes across the life span and how they impact function. A logical, easy-to-read format includes 15 chapters organized into three units covering basics, body systems, and age-related functional outcomes respectively. Expanded integration of ICF (International Classification of Function) aligns learning and critical thinking with current health care models. Additional clinical examples help you apply developmental information to clinical practice. Updates cover the typical performance on standardized tests of balance and add quality-of-life scales and functional assessment measures to enhance the essential framework for clinical practice. More concise information on the normal anatomy and physiology of each body system allows a sharper focus on development changes across the lifespan and how they impact function. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The literature survey 2009 is based on 743 papers found in the databases MEDLINE and EMBASE with the keywords "thermography" or "thermometry" or "thermotherapy" or 'skin temperature' or 'core temperature' and restricted to "humans" and "included in the databases between 01-01 and 31-12 2009". 43 percent of papers of this review are originated from Europe and 91.5 percent of all papers are written in English. 266 controlled studies using some kind of temperature measurement were reported. Physiology, surgery, dermatology, neurology, clinical and experimental pharmacology were the predominant fields of applications of temperature measurement in medicine. Therapeutic hyperthermia and hypothermia treatment was the topic of many papers. Fever attracted also a high publication interest. Only some papers were related to intravascular temperature measurement, Raynaud's phenomenon or breast thermography.

AB  - Traumatic minor cervical strains are common place in high-impact sports (e.g. tackling) and premature degenerative changes have been documented in sports people exposed to recurrent impact trauma (e.g. scrummaging in rugby) or repetitive forces (e.g. Formula 1 racing drivers, jockeys). While proprioceptive exercises have been an integral part of rehabilitation of injuries in the lower limb, they have not featured as prominently in the treatment of cervical injuries. However, head and neck position sense (HNPS) testing and re-training may have relevance in the management of minor sports-related neck injuries, and play a role in reducing the incidence of ongoing pain and problems with function. For efficacious programmes to be developed and tested, fundamental principles associated with proprioception in the cervical spine should be considered. Hence, this article highlights the importance of anatomical structures in the cervical spine responsible for position sense, and how their interaction with the CNS affects our ability to plan and execute effective purposeful movements. This article includes a review of studies examining position sense in subjects with and without pathology and describes the effects of rehabilitation programmes that have sought to improve position sense. In respect to the receptors providing proprioceptive information for the CNS, the high densities and complex arrays of spindles found in cervical muscles suggest that these receptors play a key role. There is some evidence suggesting that ensemble encoding of discharge patterns from muscle spindles is relayed to the CNS and that a pattern recognition system is used to establish joint position and movement. Sensory information from neck proprioceptive receptors is processed in tandem with information from the vestibular system. There are extensive anatomical connections between neck proprioceptive inputs and vestibular inputs. If positional information from the vestibular system is inaccurate or fails to be appropriately integrated in the CNS, errors in head position may occur, resulting in an inaccurate reference for HNPS, and conversely if neck proprioceptive information is inaccurate, then control of head position may be affected. The cerebellum and cortex also play a role in control of head position, providing feed-forward and modulatory influences depending on the task requirements. Position-matching tasks have been the most popular means of testing position sense in the cervical spine. These allow the appreciation of absolute, constant and variable errors in positioning and have been shown to be reliable. The results of such tests indicate that errors are relatively low (2-5°). It is apparent that error is not consistently affected by age, a finding similar to studies undertaken in peripheral joints. Furthermore, the range of motion in which subjects are tested does not consistently affect accuracy in a predictable manner. However, it is evident that impairments in position sense are observed in individuals who have experienced whiplash-type injuries and individuals with chronic head and neck pain of non-traumatic origin (e.g. cervical spondylosis). While researchers advocate comprehensive retraining protocols, which include eye and neck motion targeting tasks and coordination exercises, as well as co-contraction exercises to reduce such impairments, some studies show that more general exercises and manipulation may be of benefit. Overall, there is limited information concerning the efficacy of treatment programmes. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

AB  - For a long time, human beings have dreamed of a virtual world where it is possible to interact with synthetic entities as if they were real. It has been shown that the ability to touch virtual objects increases the sense of presence in virtual environments. This book provides an authoritative overview of state-of-theart haptic rendering algorithms and their applications. The authors examine various approaches and techniques for designing touch-enabled interfaces for a number of applications, including medical training, model design, and maintainability analysis for virtual prototyping, scientific visualization, and creative processes. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We compared single leg jumping capability in 20 patients with a functional unstable ankle joint with a control group of 20 volunteers with a healthy ankle joint. Additionally we evaluated the influence of two ankle braces. The healthy subjects presented with a slightly shorter total time for finishing the parcour without showing a significant difference. Looking specifically for the time the subjects needed for ankle stabilisation after landing, even in the control group the stabilisation time was shorter with than without a brace. In patients with unstable ankle joints this time was also significant shorter with a brace. There was no difference between both braces. In both groups supination strain showed shorter stabilizing time than pronation strain. Conclusion: In the presented setup ankle braces had a positive effect on single leg jumping capability. Supination strain can be stabilized better than pronation strain.
